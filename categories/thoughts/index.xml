Basic summary: &amp;#8220;everyone is and can be creative: you just have to be fearless about failing, and practice a bunch.&amp;#8221;
Led to this understanding by my art-teacher mother, since early childhood I&amp;#8217;ve been saying something pretty similar.
Creativity is wonderful, amazing, useful, freeing, and fun&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s not rare. Being creative is a skill, available to everyone. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be &amp;#8220;Art&amp;#8221; (note the capital A) nor innovation. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be shared.</description>

      <description>An excellent article on Walmart being evil or not &amp;#8211; a fairly objective seeming overview of the major points of discussion for the different camps on Walmart.
 That&amp;#8217;s a good thing, right? If a company achieves its lower prices by finding better and smarter ways of doing things, then yes, everybody wins. But if it cuts costs by cutting pay and benefits&amp;#8211;or by sending production to China&amp;#8211;then not everybody wins.</description>

      <description>364: Going Big
All of TAL is always great, moving, funny, and every other positive adjective I could think of (yes, I&amp;#8217;m a fanboy)&amp;#8230; but the first act in this show is about baby education and it&amp;#8217;s importance&amp;#8230;
 Paul Tough reports on the Harlem Children’s Zone, and its CEO and president, Geoffrey Canada. Among the project’s many facets is Baby College, an 8-week program where young parents and parents-to-be learn how to help their children get the education they need to be successful.</description>

      <description>Rwandans look to Louisville for interfaith model
 The Rwandans invited the center&amp;#8217;s executive director, Jan Arnow, to visit their country, where in May, she conducted workshops and discussions with a group that included various faiths, from Muslims to Catholics to Quakers to Pentecostals.
During that visit, she said, group members told her, &amp;#8220;We want to do what your organization does&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; leading to establishment of the center&amp;#8217;s first branch outside Kentucky.</description>

      <title>Hubble Ultra Deep Field – a sense of proportion</title>

      <description>As Douglas Adams put, humans really can&amp;#8217;t deal with having a sense of proportion.&amp;nbsp; We aren&amp;#8217;t capable.&amp;nbsp; But we can stretch for it&amp;#8230;
(I can touch my toes, but I can&amp;#8217;t bend further over&amp;#8230; but I should try to)
Take 5 minutes and read this fantastic piece on an image from Hubble Ultra Deep Field.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a great reminder of what we know about space and a few tools to help you start to realize that you can&amp;#8217;t ever come close to grasping a true sense of proportion.</description>

      <description>Well&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s been a day &amp;#8211; just like any other day.&amp;nbsp; I wore black&amp;#8230; biked to work&amp;#8230; worked&amp;#8230; biked home and walked in the park with Anita and Nova.&amp;nbsp; A beautiful day.&amp;nbsp; Nothing in my day to tie this date with six years ago&amp;#8230; I was looking for it to come up.
Perhaps if I watched television more, or talked to strangers more&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; perhaps if I got out of my daily life and tried to make a change in the world which reflected my beliefs (such as they are)&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; perhaps if I didn&amp;#8217;t live so comfortably I&amp;#8217;d work to fix what seems obviously wrong with the world.</description>

      <title>Letter to the editor: Republicans need to step out from behind their false mask of security</title>

      <description>Five years after 9&amp;frasl;11, the Bush administration has failed to keep us safe. In fact, we are less safe.
The war in Iraq has diverted attention from protecting America from terrorism. In fact, this past week 9&amp;frasl;11 commissioners said Iraq is distracting from security at home.
The war in Iraq has inflamed the whole Middle East and is helping Al Qaeda attract new recruits. Osama Bin Laden is still on the loose.</description>

      <description>Text of an email I spammed to just about everyone I have an address for:
 ===INTRO==============
I&amp;#8217;m sorry to have sent what could be considered propaganda to you. I believe it&amp;#8217;s well put together and raises very important questions, furthermore validating those questions and invalidating many official responses with evidence. Because of this, and because it&amp;#8217;s so easy to send around (just a link to a video) I have decided to send it to just about everyone in my address book.</description>

      <description>1000th &amp;ldquo;Death Penalty&amp;rdquo; murder since reinstating in 1976
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it seem strange to be killing people for killing people?&amp;nbsp; I am aware that there are people that are dangerous enough to never let back into the population, but it seems hypocritical to kill them&amp;hellip; Aside from the people who are significant dangers to our society, prisons should generally be cleared out a lot.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
We are a nation built on and ruled by fear.</description>

      <description>The World Can&amp;rsquo;t Wait&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a site promoting active options for ridding ourselves of the current blight named G. W. Bush.&amp;nbsp;
   Yes, I believe blight is an appropriate term&amp;hellip; I mean seriously, how will our history books record this era in our country?&amp;nbsp; The American people were duped, and when they realized it, they were ok with it&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; disappoing sounding eh?     Good reading:   Oct.</description>

      <description>September 9th, it was ruled that Jose Padilla was still not to be given fair trial, in fact not to be charged with a crime nor to be given legal council.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s the first time this has ever happened in the US court system (to my knowledge)&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; Even actual &amp;ldquo;enemy combatants&amp;rdquo; in our previous wars, captured on the battlefield all got lawyers and full legal procedings.&amp;nbsp; Our courts were used, to verify and justify and validate.</description>

      <description>Katrina
It&amp;rsquo;s a huge disaster.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is probably aware of that.&amp;nbsp; To put it in perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s [Katrina
It&amp;rsquo;s a huge disaster.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is probably aware of that.&amp;nbsp; To put it in perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s]2 many other natural and un-natural disasters other countries or even this country has had to deal with (or cause)&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s still really bad. [the worst hurricanes]
So, we use this as an opportunity to blame other people and talk about who should have done what and why we weren&amp;rsquo;t prepaired and aren&amp;rsquo;t handling the situation well now [link].</description>
