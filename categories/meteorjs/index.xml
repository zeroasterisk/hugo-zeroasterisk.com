      <description>Last night I started playing with `meteor &amp;#8211;release 0.9.2-rc1` which you can read about and play with too; check it out here:
https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Cordova-Z5n6zkVB1xq
It&amp;#8217;s wonderful!
The local development and hot-code-push is a great improvement over any other solution I&amp;#8217;ve been using. Builds were painless (mostly).
Most of my stumbling points were due to 9x, not the new Cordova stuff.
A few interesting details&amp;#8230;
Cordova gets built here:

      <title>Meteor Core Cordova Support – Alpha Release is out</title>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve been watching this for a while, but now the first Alpha release is out for Meteor + Cordova built into the core.
SWEET!
Watch the DevShop Presentation on it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzNoXbv1DX4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=24m
&amp;nbsp;
And here are instructions to get it going and play with it: https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Cordova-Z5n6zkVB1xq
&amp;nbsp;
Also, just an update, MeteorRider is still a strong and simple option for getting Meteor into Cordova (DOM hijacking), but I&amp;#8217;m also checking out another great looking option is Cordova Loader (builds all Cordova assets into the public folder of Meteor).</description>

      <description>http://readme.lk/noticed-tech-crowd-interview-arunoda-susiripala/
This advice might be aimed at people who already consider themselves developers, but there&amp;#8217;s a nugget in there that&amp;#8217;s perfect for anyone who is interested in getting started&amp;#8230;
Pick some open-source project, probably a smaller one, that does something you&amp;#8217;re interested in. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and used. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and it didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you looked at and didn&amp;#8217;t understand.</description>

About Meteor and PhoneGap / Cordova Meteor is a rapid server/client development framework, written in JS &amp;#8211; makes very interactive apps easy to build. http://meteor.com
PhoneGap / Cordova is a project to allow developers to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build mobile apps for all major devices. http://phonegap.com
Basics of Integrating Meteor + PhoneGap / Cordova The basic idea here is to use PhoneGap / Cordova to create a mobile App on several different platforms at once and it gives device hardware access; then “load” your Meteor application, which handles all of the rest of whatever you want your app to do.</description>
