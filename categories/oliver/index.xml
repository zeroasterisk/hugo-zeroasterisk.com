      <description>Oliver has been feeling a bit sick for a couple of days, and it was acute yesterday early afternoon &amp;#8211; he was doing the &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m in pain&amp;#8221; cry for a half an hour straight and was inconsolable. Very unusual for him. So we made an appointment to see the Pediatrician and by the time we got in there (~3 hours later) he seemed pretty normal, though really tired still because he is sick and doing all the extra crying, but sleeping and eating ok again.</description>
