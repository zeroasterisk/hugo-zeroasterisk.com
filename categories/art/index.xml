Basic summary: &amp;#8220;everyone is and can be creative: you just have to be fearless about failing, and practice a bunch.&amp;#8221;
Led to this understanding by my art-teacher mother, since early childhood I&amp;#8217;ve been saying something pretty similar.
Creativity is wonderful, amazing, useful, freeing, and fun&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s not rare. Being creative is a skill, available to everyone. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be &amp;#8220;Art&amp;#8221; (note the capital A) nor innovation. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be shared.</description>

      <description>My mom and her friend Joanne painted a wonderful mural on Poppy&amp;#8217;s room. I decided to play with a very fun tool called photosynth to stitch together several photos into one unified picture or the room in 3-D (sort of). It will not work except on IE and FF and you may need to install a viewer (it&amp;#8217;s safe, but an annoyance). Regardless, this is my first photosynth and I may make more&amp;#8230; not sure at the moment.</description>

      <description>If anyone in the &amp;#8216;ville hasn&amp;#8217;t heard about the New Skyscraper for Louisville &amp;#8211; check it out&amp;#8230; It looks really cool (in my opinion) and would be a great thing to claim for the city&amp;#8230; not to mention, it&amp;#8217;d be very nice to have a modern art museum (in a building island, no less).
Also &amp;#8211; a new google desktop search looks good (as expected).</description>

      <description>I just heard from my good friend (and former employer) Dave Caudill and got up to speed on his recent newsletters.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m glad to see he&amp;rsquo;s still making great art and getting it out in the world&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s also nice to hear the human side of the story, about the places he visits, what he sees, and often what he eats&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;
The most appealing of these recent travels, for me, is the Grounds for Sculpture&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Hamilton, New Jersey (</description>
