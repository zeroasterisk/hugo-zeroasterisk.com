Basic summary: &amp;#8220;everyone is and can be creative: you just have to be fearless about failing, and practice a bunch.&amp;#8221;
Led to this understanding by my art-teacher mother, since early childhood I&amp;#8217;ve been saying something pretty similar.
Creativity is wonderful, amazing, useful, freeing, and fun&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s not rare. Being creative is a skill, available to everyone. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be &amp;#8220;Art&amp;#8221; (note the capital A) nor innovation. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be shared.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a crazy winter, the last week. The ice storm which took out most of KY&amp;#8217;s power only kept us out for a couple of days, but still has some friends down. It was crazy to see all of the trees weighed down and drooping, beautiful and terrible. The ice coated everything, and when the wind blew all of the ice-coated limbs and branched clinked with each other.
Here&amp;#8217;s a great photo from a friend of mine, mitch:</description>

      <description>This is an absolutely crazy base-jumping video, with wing suits. If I didn&amp;#8217;t have the life and family I have now, I could see myself wanting to do this, but there&amp;#8217;s too much risk involved for me and I&amp;#8217;ve got too much to loose. Still &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s awesome to see.

      <title>we refinanced our mortgage today</title>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/12/17/we-refinanced-our-mortgage-today/</guid>
      <description>We have refinanced (or at least started the process) and locked in at 4.96 after paying a point (it was 5.6 without the point, lenders wanting up-front money and assurance in today&amp;#8217;s market). We are rolling in the point and closing costs into the new loan and we&amp;#8217;ll still be saving $140/month over our current loan (and if we hadn&amp;#8217;t rolled in the costs, it would only have saved us $21/month more).</description>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/12/13/the-mates-of-state-the-story-of-taking-the-family-on-tour/</guid>
      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a great video done by Dan Harris of ABC news on the Mates of State and what the family does when they go on tour.
I love the wholesomeness of it and it fits right in with what I think they would be like.&amp;nbsp; This band is one of my absolute favorites and that&amp;#8217;s only encouraged by this peak into their good parenting and family priorities.

      <description>I have never developed a taste for coffee, personally, but I love the smell and I do love all the sugary-icey-foo-foo drinks.&amp;nbsp; Here&amp;#8217;s an entertaining story about coffee from Christoph Niemann, an illustrator at The New Yorker, Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times Magazine and American Illustration.

      <description>364: Going Big
All of TAL is always great, moving, funny, and every other positive adjective I could think of (yes, I&amp;#8217;m a fanboy)&amp;#8230; but the first act in this show is about baby education and it&amp;#8217;s importance&amp;#8230;
 Paul Tough reports on the Harlem Children’s Zone, and its CEO and president, Geoffrey Canada. Among the project’s many facets is Baby College, an 8-week program where young parents and parents-to-be learn how to help their children get the education they need to be successful.</description>

      <title>Prescription drugs in drinking water</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/03/11/prescription-drugs-in-drinking-water/</link>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/03/11/prescription-drugs-in-drinking-water/</guid>
      <description>A vast array of pharmaceuticals &amp;#8212; including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones &amp;#8212; have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans, an Associated Press investigation shows
To be sure, the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals are tiny, measured in quantities of parts per billion or trillion, far below the levels of a medical dose. Also, utilities insist their water is safe.
But the presence of so many prescription drugs &amp;#8212; and over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen &amp;#8212; in so much of our drinking water is heightening worries among scientists of long-term consequences to human health.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s long, but great &amp;#8211; go read the Nerd Handbook and understand your favorite nerds just a bit more. &amp;nbsp;Here&amp;#8217;s a quote from the top:
 Understand your nerd’s relation to the computer. It’s clichéd, but a nerd is defined by his computer, and you need to understand why.
First, a majority of the folks on the planet either have no idea how
a computer works or they look at it and think “it’s magic”.</description>

      <description>I recently came up with a VERY simple algebraic equation&amp;#8230; trying to figure out how many months it would take for something to become cost effective.&amp;nbsp; I looked at the equation and thought I would see if google search could solve it (it can solve basic math problems and even unit conversions), but google couldn&amp;#8217;t handle it.&amp;nbsp; So I thought I&amp;#8217;d see if there was something else.&amp;nbsp; It took no time to find Algebrahelp.</description>

      <description>As Douglas Adams put, humans really can&amp;#8217;t deal with having a sense of proportion.&amp;nbsp; We aren&amp;#8217;t capable.&amp;nbsp; But we can stretch for it&amp;#8230;
(I can touch my toes, but I can&amp;#8217;t bend further over&amp;#8230; but I should try to)
Take 5 minutes and read this fantastic piece on an image from Hubble Ultra Deep Field.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a great reminder of what we know about space and a few tools to help you start to realize that you can&amp;#8217;t ever come close to grasping a true sense of proportion.</description>

      <description>The Ultimate Sport &amp;#8211; WSJ.com:
 Besides being relatively inexpensive to play, part of Ultimate&amp;#8217;s appeal lies in the fact that stature isn&amp;#8217;t as critical as speed and dexterity: catching, throwing, jumping and pivoting. One of the star players for the Filipino team Pula, Panoy de los Santos, for instance, is just 1.57-meters tall (but the fastest member of the team). Another attraction is that Ultimate is a noncontact game, so women like it as much as men do &amp;#8212; 35% of the 500 players in the Philippines are female.</description>

      <description>Text of an email I spammed to just about everyone I have an address for:
 ===INTRO==============
I&amp;#8217;m sorry to have sent what could be considered propaganda to you. I believe it&amp;#8217;s well put together and raises very important questions, furthermore validating those questions and invalidating many official responses with evidence. Because of this, and because it&amp;#8217;s so easy to send around (just a link to a video) I have decided to send it to just about everyone in my address book.</description>

      <description>If you didn&amp;#8217;t already know&amp;#8230; Pandora.com.&amp;nbsp; Yes, that&amp;#8217;s right.
What?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You want to know what I&amp;#8217;m talking about?&amp;nbsp;
Simply, it&amp;#8217;s a brilliant option for listen to music.&amp;nbsp; You go to that site, create an ID (only requires an email address) and you get a personalized (personalizable) streaming radio station determined from a seed artist or song.
How does it know what music to select?&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s made by the people who did the music gennome project, so they have littereally mapped and classified music (fairly well, it seems) and allow you to guide your station(s) accordingly&amp;#8230; bring in variety or isolate to a single vein; the choice is yours&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>I have setup a Flickr account/profile and played with it some&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; it&amp;#8217;s totally awesome.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;ve heard of it for years, but haven&amp;#8217;t needed anything like it, since I have gallery installed on a server on which I have nigh&amp;#8217;-unlimited storage space&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;
Anyway &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s my excuse for being slow to jump on this bandwagon&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;m here now.
The only question is deciding if I want to make the switch and pay for an unlimited account&amp;#8230; then move all the photos I have in gallery into flickr&amp;#8230; and worry about when their server goes down or looses all of my photos (not that such is likely, but less under my control).</description>

      <description>So, in August, apparentally, Jeno went to Peru&amp;#8230; It looks like she toured the countryside and hiked up mountains&amp;#8230; went to the amazon rainforest, boated across pink-dolphin infested waters, and got friendly with sheep and mules alike.
I want the full story&amp;#8230; if i get it I will post it somewhere&amp;#8230;. perhaps I can convince her to start a blog of her own&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Pre-Halloween Party : Hell House II
Well, as with pretty much all DJ Foursquare (and hushabye house) parties, this was a great event. Chill people, great crowd, good venue (effective at least), great music, etc&amp;#8230; It also benifited from a great collection of costumes and a very moderate and (sorry for this review) disney-land-like bondage show&amp;#8230; Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t think the crew was disney-land&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure they had to weak-i-fy their setup/show for the audience invovled.</description>

      <description>I recently found out about what appears to be a great group called ApolloAlliance, which is setup in many states including Ohio and Kentucky.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good information there, including how to get invovled in local communities as well as how to become more energy efficient.&amp;nbsp; (they&amp;rsquo;ve even got job listings)
Since I&amp;rsquo;m on the topic, I want to recommend anyone interested in energy conservationism (or conservationism in general) in the Louisville Kentucky area to check out the BRKST wiki (breakset resources and knowledge for sustainable thought) run by Jason Smithson.</description>

      <description>I feel like a spectator admiring athletes reading things like the this blog post [Semantic Wikipedia - At last one of dreams is at the verge of coming true.], but an excited spectator, none the less.
Wiki is already a fantastic tool for simple (or complex) content management, accessible to anyone within a few minutes&amp;#8230; This proposed innovation would add the ability to add, inline, extra relationships which build a more complete (and interoperable) logical structure.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a huge disaster.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is probably aware of that.&amp;nbsp; To put it in perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s]2 many other natural and un-natural disasters other countries or even this country has had to deal with (or cause)&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s still really bad. [the worst hurricanes]
So, we use this as an opportunity to blame other people and talk about who should have done what and why we weren&amp;rsquo;t prepaired and aren&amp;rsquo;t handling the situation well now [link].</description>

      <description>So &amp;#8211; Capture the Flag was a lot of fun. We played at the Park of Roses on August 21 2005 (after sundown). We had 9 people show and had a great time, though we were out classed severely by some &amp;#8220;in shape&amp;#8221; players. I&amp;#8217;m hoping to end up with more people in a bigger area for the next game on September 9th (friday) at an unknown location.
Google is incredible.</description>

Skin Cells Converted to Stem Cells which means we have &amp;#8220;starter cells&amp;#8221; for transplants and the like and don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about the moral issues raised from using the tissues of aborted fetuses (feti?). [Bush&amp;rsquo;s statement on this]
I&amp;#8217;ve heard of this before, though&amp;#8230; In fact, in a previous article from the Washing Post. My question really is, what is the quantity we are talking about? If we could produce enough stem cells to generate real tissues, doesn&amp;#8217;t that kinda sound like vat grown replacement parts&amp;#8230;.</description>
