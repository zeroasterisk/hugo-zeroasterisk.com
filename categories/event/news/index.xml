      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a crazy winter, the last week. The ice storm which took out most of KY&amp;#8217;s power only kept us out for a couple of days, but still has some friends down. It was crazy to see all of the trees weighed down and drooping, beautiful and terrible. The ice coated everything, and when the wind blew all of the ice-coated limbs and branched clinked with each other.
Here&amp;#8217;s a great photo from a friend of mine, mitch:</description>

      <description>Helping to Write History
By Eli Saslow
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 18, 2008; Page A01
 During the campaign, the buzz-cut 27-year-old at the corner table helped write and edit some of the most memorable speeches of any recent presidential candidate. When Obama moves to the White House next month, Favreau will join his staff as the youngest person ever to be selected as chief speechwriter. He helps shape almost every word Obama says, yet the two men have formed a concert so harmonized that Favreau&amp;#8217;s own voice disappears.</description>

      <title>we refinanced our mortgage today</title>

      <description>We have refinanced (or at least started the process) and locked in at 4.96 after paying a point (it was 5.6 without the point, lenders wanting up-front money and assurance in today&amp;#8217;s market). We are rolling in the point and closing costs into the new loan and we&amp;#8217;ll still be saving $140/month over our current loan (and if we hadn&amp;#8217;t rolled in the costs, it would only have saved us $21/month more).</description>

      <description>I thought this was a very interesting article
Birth Control Pills Affect Women&amp;#8217;s Taste in Men
 It’s all about scent. Hidden in a man’s smell are clues about his major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which play an important role in immune system surveillance. Studies suggest that females prefer the scent of males whose MHC genes differ from their own, a preference that has probably evolved because it helps offspring survive: couples with different MHC genes are less likely to be related to each other than couples with similar genes are, and their children are born with more varied MHC profiles and thus more robust immune systems.</description>

      <description>We had gotten VERY excited about a house we were going to buy.
We made an offer, they countered, we accepted&amp;#8230; all today (Sunday). We were waiting on the counter-offer-paperwork to sign and send back&amp;#8230; well, instead of getting that, we actually got notified that the offer was retracted. Someone else made a better offer and we weren&amp;#8217;t given an option to bid back.
Of course, this was after we&amp;#8217;d told everyone and after we&amp;#8217;d gotten really, really excited about this house.</description>

      <description>This Jan. we thought it would be a good time to start looking for houses, since the rates came down&amp;#8230; but being slow and you know, having a child &amp;#8211; we just recently got out and actually looked at houses.
By now the rates are over 6% for a standard 30yr mortgage. We have perfect credit and decent everything else&amp;#8230; but the lenders are just not passing along the reduced rates.</description>

      <title>Prescription drugs in drinking water</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/03/11/prescription-drugs-in-drinking-water/</link>

      <description>A vast array of pharmaceuticals &amp;#8212; including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones &amp;#8212; have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans, an Associated Press investigation shows
To be sure, the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals are tiny, measured in quantities of parts per billion or trillion, far below the levels of a medical dose. Also, utilities insist their water is safe.
But the presence of so many prescription drugs &amp;#8212; and over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen &amp;#8212; in so much of our drinking water is heightening worries among scientists of long-term consequences to human health.</description>

      <description>A good and busy Christmas this year.&amp;nbsp; We stayed in Louisville because Anita&amp;#8217;s too close to due-date to travel.&amp;nbsp; Had 7 different family engagements in two days and enjoyed every one&amp;#8230; though at the end of things we are certainly tired.&amp;nbsp; We had too much food and too much sugar, enough sleep and a great amount of fun.

 TOYOTA CITY, Japan&amp;#8211;While you&amp;#8217;re touring the assembly area in Toyota&amp;#8217;s Tsutsumi auto plant, your mind keeps telling you that you&amp;#8217;ve been here before. Then it hits you.
It&amp;#8217;s a lot like the Snow White ride at Disneyland. Robotic cars filled up with wiper blades and other parts amble along a track in the floor, taking parts from the procurement department to other ends of the factory.</description>

      <description>Engineered cells beat cancer in human test | Chicago Tribune:
 In a small study of patients with terminal skin cancer, Maryland scientists have demonstrated for the first time that genetically engineered immune cells can kill off large tumors.
The research, conducted by a team at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, remains highly experimental, and it worked on just two of the 17 patients in the study.
But excited government scientists said it is the first time gene therapy has vanquished an advanced cancer.</description>

      <description>Anita, our step sister Maddie (14), and I went to Houston, from July 20 through August 1st.&amp;nbsp; We drove.
[map] First, we drove to and camped at the Hot Springs National Park, during the hottest part of a heat wave.&amp;nbsp; Our A/C could occasionally not keep up, it was so hot&amp;#8230; so when we ended up at the park, we went wading (which turned into swimming for some) in a creek that ran through the park.</description>

Republicans prevented more than 350,000 voters in Ohio from casting ballots or having their votes counted &amp;#8212; enough to have put John Kerry in the White House. BY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.
This is a great article, full of well cited and reasoned points&amp;#8230; pointing towards a conclusion which may well get you branded as a conspiracy theorist&amp;#8230; but still seems the most likely explanation.</description>

      <description>According to the article: Transcendental meditation good for stress: study it goes a bit further than just getting relaxed&amp;#8230;
 Practicing transcendental medicine not only mellows the mind but may also calm the body&amp;#8217;s damaging responses to stress that leads to heart disease and diabetes, researchers said on Monday.
&amp;#8230;
Meditation has been previously shown to lower blood pressure, but researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, found it also decreased heart rate variability and insulin sensitivity.</description>

 ===INTRO==============
I&amp;#8217;m sorry to have sent what could be considered propaganda to you. I believe it&amp;#8217;s well put together and raises very important questions, furthermore validating those questions and invalidating many official responses with evidence. Because of this, and because it&amp;#8217;s so easy to send around (just a link to a video) I have decided to send it to just about everyone in my address book.</description>

 Google today announced a new &amp;#8220;feature&amp;#8221; of its Google Desktop software that greatly increases the risk to consumer privacy.

      <description>I was recently sent a link to the article Explosive Testimony: Revelations about the Twin Towers in the 9&amp;frasl;11 Oral Histories, on the site 911truth.org. I think the article, though kind of long, deserves a read. I wasn&amp;#8217;t there but i agree that something happened&amp;#8230;. it is almost unbelievably incredible that both towers collapsed in such a seemingly controlled manner. If towers / buildings collapsed like that by design, building demolition companies wouldn&amp;#8217;t have a job&amp;#8230;.</description>

Basically, if I was taken to prison for thinking our current government sucks (or for being too cynical or too naive), I would want people to know about it&amp;#8230; and hopefully make a fuss&amp;#8230; you know&amp;#8230; maybe get to talk to a lawyer and not be tortured.</description>

      <description>Pre-Halloween Party : Hell House II
Well, as with pretty much all DJ Foursquare (and hushabye house) parties, this was a great event. Chill people, great crowd, good venue (effective at least), great music, etc&amp;#8230; It also benifited from a great collection of costumes and a very moderate and (sorry for this review) disney-land-like bondage show&amp;#8230; Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t think the crew was disney-land&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure they had to weak-i-fy their setup/show for the audience invovled.</description>

      <description>I played ultimate frisbee today, one of the last evening games of the year.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s been getting dark earlier every week and now we have to stop playing around 7:15&amp;hellip; when you start at 6:00 of after, that&amp;rsquo;s really frustrating.
What might have been frustrating was that it was cold and rainy today, starting to be really ugly right about the time we started playing&amp;hellip; but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t frustrating at all.</description>

      <description>The World Can&amp;rsquo;t Wait&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a site promoting active options for ridding ourselves of the current blight named G. W. Bush.&amp;nbsp;
   Yes, I believe blight is an appropriate term&amp;hellip; I mean seriously, how will our history books record this era in our country?&amp;nbsp; The American people were duped, and when they realized it, they were ok with it&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; disappoing sounding eh?

      <description>Sporting Events cause a drop in ER visits
Ok, this is kindof rediculous&amp;#8230; Apparently, Americans put off their emergency room visits, or just don&amp;#8217;t have as many problems, during major sporting events. I can understand being into sports, but that seems unreal.
Helicopters Scour Louisiana Floodwaters (Rita Aftermath)
 People checking their hurricane-hit homes and towns returned with stories of flooding to the rooftops, coffins and refrigerators bobbing in the water, and stilts where their houses once stood.</description>

      <description>Rita Update:
Rita, as a Category 3 hurricane (120 mph) made landfall at 2:30 a.m. CDT today in extreme southwest Louisiana between Sabine Pass and Johnson&amp;#8217;s Bayou, La. Port Arthur, Texas, clocked maximum wind gusts of 116 mph, while Beaumont, Texas, measured 105 mph. Cameron, La., reported a gust to 112 mph before the anemometer failed. Storm surge flooding of up to 15 feet probably occured just east of where the eye thundered ashore.</description>

      <description>Challenged by Creationists, Museums Answer Back
(sorry, the link requires login)
Apparently, after a few rather agressive (not phiscally) confrontations with creationists, in science museums &amp;#8211; docents and volunteers are flocking to training on how to best respond to such challenges.
&amp;#8220;The goal is to understand the controversies, so that people are better able to handle them as they come up,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;Museums, as a field, have recognized we need to take a more proactive role in evolution education.</description>

      <description>Clinton launches withering attack on Bush on Iraq, Katrina, budget
Breaking with tradition under which US presidents mute criticisms of their successors, Clinton said the Bush administration had decided to invade Iraq &amp;#8220;virtually alone and before UN inspections were completed, with no real urgency, no evidence that there were weapons of mass destruction.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8230;
&amp;#8220;What Americans need to understand is that &amp;#8230; every single day of the year, our government goes into the market and borrows money from other countries to finance Iraq, Afghanistan, Katrina, and our tax cuts,&amp;#8221; he said.</description>

      <description>Saturday Anita had to work, but Phil, Sarah, Jess, and Phil&amp;rsquo;s friend Tom came over and played Mao&amp;nbsp;1.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s a great game &amp;ndash; and surprisingly effective at bringing about a represive dictatorial feel in the players (who thought that could be so much fun?).&amp;nbsp;
We played a variant where after winning 3 rounds you could make up your own rule&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; my personal favorite was (my rule): you have to use rapper hands whenever you call penalty on someone.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a huge disaster.&amp;nbsp; Everyone is probably aware of that.&amp;nbsp; To put it in perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s]2 many other natural and un-natural disasters other countries or even this country has had to deal with (or cause)&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s still really bad.

So, we use this as an opportunity to blame other people and talk about who should have done what and why we weren&amp;rsquo;t prepaired and aren&amp;rsquo;t handling the situation well now [link].</description>

      <description>So &amp;#8211; Capture the Flag was a lot of fun. We played at the Park of Roses on August 21 2005 (after sundown). We had 9 people show and had a great time, though we were out classed severely by some &amp;#8220;in shape&amp;#8221; players. I&amp;#8217;m hoping to end up with more people in a bigger area for the next game on September 9th (friday) at an unknown location.
Google is incredible.</description>

Skin Cells Converted to Stem Cells which means we have &amp;#8220;starter cells&amp;#8221; for transplants and the like and don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about the moral issues raised from using the tissues of aborted fetuses (feti?). [Bush&amp;rsquo;s statement on this]
I&amp;#8217;ve heard of this before, though&amp;#8230; In fact, in a previous article from the Washing Post. My question really is, what is the quantity we are talking about? If we could produce enough stem cells to generate real tissues, doesn&amp;#8217;t that kinda sound like vat grown replacement parts&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>We have kittens.

That&amp;#8217;s right, it&amp;#8217;s cute-fest-2005 in our apartment right now. We got a pair of 8 6 week old kittens on Sunday from Anita&amp;#8217;s co-worker who got them dumped on her by her mom. They are a brother (black) and sister (white &amp;amp; orange) and have very quickly bonded with Anita and I&amp;#8230; they are ok with Nova, but she&amp;#8217;s not yet ok with them. Nova actually submitted to them, belly up and looking away; our guard dog proving her grit once again.</description>

_However, I did want to let everyone know that I am
safe and perfectly whole after this morning&amp;#8217;s earthquake. For those of you
who have no idea what I&amp;#8217;m talking about, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit
Japan at 11:46 this morning and I was a mere 60 some-odd kilometers south of
its center of its origin. It&amp;#8217;s on the front page of BBC, CNN, MSN-NBC, etc.</description>

      <description>I have implemented a blogging system on my site (utilizing WordPress) and modified the display of my wiki to play well with the blog&amp;#8230; The basics of the change are making the content fixed width, and moving the &amp;#8220;article, discussion, edit, history, etc&amp;#8221; tabs to a sidebar component on the wiki&amp;#8230; then coming up with a shared header&amp;#8230;
I still need to get the old blog entries into this system (very do-able), and I am thinking a homepage not in the wiki, is appropriate&amp;#8230; either that or i should get rid of the &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221; link in the header&amp;#8230; hurumph &amp;#8211; i think i&amp;#8217;m going to remove the &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221; link in the header now (since it&amp;#8217;s the same as the wiki link for now).</description>
