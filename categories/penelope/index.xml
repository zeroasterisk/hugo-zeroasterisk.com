      <title>poppy’s first day of school</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2009/08/19/poppys-first-day-of-school/</link>

      <description>Poppy&amp;#8217;s really thinned out and sped up. At 18 months, she&amp;#8217;s about the same height as she was at 14 months, but seems much more thin. Must be all the running, jumping, and climbing she does. She can happily run in a circle for 15 minutes, or bounce on a bed for 30.
She&amp;#8217;s started school at &amp;#8220;The Friend&amp;#8217;s School&amp;#8221; this week, in the 1 year old class three days a week for three hours each day.</description>

      <description>I finally uploaded some of the photos we&amp;#8217;ve recently taken&amp;#8230; Here are our two trips to various &amp;#8220;pick your own&amp;#8221; farms, for strawberries and blueberries.

      <description>Poppy is now using her potty.
She&amp;#8217;s been sitting on it for a while, but this weekend was the first time she actually used it successfully (twice so far). We, of course, cheered and encouraged her&amp;#8230; But I think it just clicked in her brain that was what she was supposed to do. I don&amp;#8217;t expect that we&amp;#8217;re going to have a terribly high success rate right away, but it&amp;#8217;s great to be on that path.</description>

      <description>Poppy is doing great. She&amp;#8217;s wearing the overalls which were rolling up so that they didn&amp;#8217;t drag, only 3 months ago&amp;#8230; now they are high-water-ready, ending up above her ankle.    
   She&amp;#8217;s certainly got an attitude and is already testing boundaries and figuring out what she can get away with. More so right now, as her i-teeth are coming in, all four at once.</description>

      <title>Poppy Update – Fast and Furious</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2009/04/02/poppy-update-fast-and-furious/</link>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2009/04/02/poppy-update-fast-and-furious/</guid>
      <description>Little poppy is fast and furious these days (at least when she doesn&amp;#8217;t get what she wants, fast enough). Turn your back and she&amp;#8217;s gone&amp;#8230;. or perhaps she&amp;#8217;s up, as in climbing up furniture. She&amp;#8217;s eating a lot (sauteed mushrooms and onions and swash and garlic, last night&amp;#8230; mmmm) and still has chubby legs and a belly on her, but for the most part has lengthened out and looks more and more like a kid and less and less like a baby.</description>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2009/03/16/poppy-spinning/</guid>
      <description>Poppy has long been termed as a &amp;#8220;rough neck&amp;#8221; and she certainly earns that title, loving to be thrown around and tickled and rough housing with her peers or adults alike.
She has just started spinning around in circles to get herself dizzy. It&amp;#8217;s one of the cutest things I&amp;#8217;ve ever witnessed.
The downside is that she already staggers like a drunk anytime she&amp;#8217;s tired and sometimes when she&amp;#8217;s not&amp;#8230; so this just adds to the appearance that she is seconds away from being face-down on the ground.</description>

      <description>Mom and Sam drove to Louisville for a few days this past weekend+ (Friday &amp;#8211; Tuesday).
We all had a wonderful visit and they played with poppy almost nonstop&amp;#8230; as expected. We took full advantage of the free babysitting and went out a few nights and on the whole, were less than adequate hosts, but they didn&amp;#8217;t seem to mind.
Mom&amp;#8217;s posted her photos here, and below is a slideshow</description>

      <description>Poppy is:
 walking well, though she still staggers like she&amp;#8217;s drunk when she&amp;#8217;s tired. sometimes eating vegetables, often not &amp;#8211; but always eating fruit and crackers are much better starting to learn a few signs&amp;#8230; she&amp;#8217;s known &amp;#8220;more&amp;#8221; for a while now, but now she can do eat and drink and occasionally a few others. certainly understands many words and phrases and tones of voice, and is starting to mimic more often&amp;#8230; sometimes putting a word in context a bit&amp;#8230; though it&amp;#8217;s a stretch and only her family would recognize these accomplishments.</description>

      <description>We had a house full for Poppy&amp;#8217;s first birthday.&amp;nbsp; Friends came in from Columbus and Lexington, but otherwise we tried to keep it family only&amp;#8230; even so we had almost 30 people over and had a wonderful time (at least those who were able to find seats).
She had her cake and ate it too.&amp;nbsp; Anita expected that she might not take to the cake straight away, but she certainly dug in, as soon as she realized that it was food and she was allowed to eat it.</description>

      <title>Poppy is babbling on all syllables</title>

      <description>Penelope is really talking these days. There are still no really discernable words, and for the most part, no reliable mimicking. We can not prompt her and expect a desired response. But she is certainly mimicking speech patterns on her own including intonation and cadence. She&amp;#8217;ll do so while toddling around the house carrying a toy or article of clothing or piece of trash. She will also babble back to you, when you&amp;#8217;re talking to her.</description>

      <description>Scott and Tami had a wonderful wedding in Columbus in late fall 2008. We went with Poppy and my mom Cathy. At the wedding they had a photobooth set up and some of the photos went into a scrapbook and some we took home&amp;#8230; here are the took home ones.</description>

      <description>My mom and her friend Joanne painted a wonderful mural on Poppy&amp;#8217;s room. I decided to play with a very fun tool called photosynth to stitch together several photos into one unified picture or the room in 3-D (sort of). It will not work except on IE and FF and you may need to install a viewer (it&amp;#8217;s safe, but an annoyance). Regardless, this is my first photosynth and I may make more&amp;#8230; not sure at the moment.</description>

      <description>We went to Houston this year, for Poppy&amp;#8217;s first Christmas and spent almost a week with my family.&amp;nbsp; Everyone loved and was amazed by Poppy, of course and she did splendidly.&amp;nbsp; She traveled quite well, sleeping for the first part of both flights and playing quietly for the second.&amp;nbsp; She also did a remarkably good job dealing with all the people she didn&amp;#8217;t really know and the back and forth craziness of going from house to house to house.</description>

      <description>We were talking about this recently and we realized that in the past two years:     We have&amp;nbsp;lived in 5 different places (our apt in Columbus, Anita&amp;#8217;s mom&amp;#8217;s for a few months, Chili&amp;#8217;s house for almost a year, Houston with my family for a couple of months, and finally our new house)     I have&amp;nbsp;worked 6 positions in 3 companies, not counting consulting gigs on the side.</description>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/12/12/poppy-is-walking-like-a-champ/</guid>
      <description>So there&amp;#8217;s no going back&amp;#8230; Though she&amp;#8217;s still holding on to fingers when offered (or when produced after her sometimes insistent request) she is walking all the way across rooms without assistance and often without falling.&amp;nbsp; For the most part, when she does fall, it&amp;#8217;s fairly controlled and without incident.
All of our childproofing is being reassessed now.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a best effort thing anyway &amp;#8211; for the most part, she&amp;#8217;s going to get into whatever she can, we just try to remove the most dangerous and delicate things from 4 feet or lower.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve finally processed and uploaded the photos from my camera.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve got new ones from september, october, and november.&amp;nbsp; Most are of Poppy, but not all of them.&amp;nbsp; Some great halloween photos, some camping, and many other occasions where the camera was brought out.

      <description>An email from my Mom who recently visited us. It&amp;#8217;s a great recap and update on Poppy, so I&amp;#8217;m just pasting in here:
 I recommend becoming a grandmother &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the best! I have just returned from a week in Louisville with Alan and Anita&amp;#8230;and Poppy, which included two Halloween parties, a wedding in Columbus, a long walk in Iroquois park to check out the fall colors, two swimming lessons for Poppy (with Anita), and progress made on Poppy&amp;#8217;s room mural by my good friend, Joan Firster and me.</description>

      <description>We went for Poppy&amp;#8217;s nine month old check up today and she is starting to slim down and lengthen. At her 7month visit, she was 19lbs and 27.5inches, and now she is holding steady at 19lbs and up to 29inches. There were no vaccines today &amp;#8211; woohoo!
After her visit and a good nap, we were playing downstairs and she took her first preliminary, wobbly steps. It was just 2-3 steps a time or 2, but it was pretty amazing.</description>

      <description>Anita recently pointed out to me that Poppy has been talking to herself for weeks.&amp;nbsp; I noticed it and never remarked on it because it seemed normal, but it is worth remarking on.
She will be crawling around, or cruising, or riding in a carrier or playing with a toy&amp;#8230; often during a period or play or concentration, she will start babbling really quietly.&amp;nbsp; A lot like talking to yourself, she just talks away while she&amp;#8217;s working on whatever she&amp;#8217;s working on.</description>

All of TAL is always great, moving, funny, and every other positive adjective I could think of (yes, I&amp;#8217;m a fanboy)&amp;#8230; but the first act in this show is about baby education and it&amp;#8217;s importance&amp;#8230;
 Paul Tough reports on the Harlem Children’s Zone, and its CEO and president, Geoffrey Canada. Among the project’s many facets is Baby College, an 8-week program where young parents and parents-to-be learn how to help their children get the education they need to be successful.</description>

      <description>Poppy has started really reaching for people when she wants to be held.&amp;nbsp; She also now will usually kiss whomever is holding her.&amp;nbsp; That kiss is often with an open mouth and extended tounge, but we&amp;#8217;re not picky &amp;#8211; it counts!
 You can tell she wants to stand all the time.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s pulling up on stuff and getting her balance and letting go with both hands, usually to fall in a second or on a good day, two&amp;#8230; but she keeps her balance well sitting and fairly well standing.</description>

      <description>Anita and many of the mom&amp;#8217;s took their offspring to Tyler Park today.
Poppy was somewhat fussy, all day and in fact all month&amp;#8230; she&amp;#8217;s getting teeth and she&amp;#8217;s frustrated that she can&amp;#8217;t really walk on her own yet.&amp;nbsp; Life is hard.
So hard, in fact, that sometimes, if you&amp;#8217;re a baby, you just gotta eat some leaves and puke&amp;#8230; which she did, with abandon.&amp;nbsp; What we didn&amp;#8217;t figure out until ~9pm tonight was that one of those leaves was stuck to the roof of her mouth for over 5 hours.</description>

      <description>My mom (Poppy&amp;#8217;s Grannie C) has visited us for a week and a half and it couldn&amp;#8217;t have been timed better. With all of Poppy&amp;#8217;s recent accomplishments, it was kind-of like meeting a whole new grandchild&amp;#8230; at least a new set of things to watch out for when poppy-sitting.
Mom painted 80% of a wonderful mural in Poppy&amp;#8217;s room, which I get to finish up over the next week or so (looking forward to doing a photo-synth of it, when done).</description>

      <title>Poppy – the dawning of the era of mobility</title>

      <description>Poppy is over seven months old now. 223 days. She&amp;#8217;s old.
In her first week of being 6 months old, she started getting her first tooth and started crawling. She quickly realized that through crawling is reliable, it&amp;#8217;s not as great as pulling up to standing and trying to coax someone or anything into keeping her upright while she staggers towards any object of her desire. Basically, we spend a lot of time with her holding onto our fingers as we stoop over and walk her around&amp;#8230; she sits when she&amp;#8217;s near something she wants.</description>

      <description>Poppy is growing up way too quickly. Anita cried a couple nights ago
watching her sleep, and I can certainly understand&amp;#8230; She hasn&amp;#8217;t
technically doubled in size, but she seems like she is at least twice
as big as she was at birth and many hundred fold more
capable/developed/skilled/aware.
She&amp;#8217;s babbling a lot, starting this weekend and she has a second tooth just under the surface ready to come out.</description>

      <description>Poppy is a feirce 6 months now. She is sitting and crawling and talking a lot (though still mostly in vowels only).
What&amp;#8217;s funny is to see her grab ahold of something (anything) and shake it.
&amp;#8220;What does this do? How about if I beat it against the floor for 5 minutes? hmmm&amp;#8230; What about after another 5 minutes?&amp;#8221;
She is so much fun to watch and interact with&amp;#8230; all she&amp;#8217;s doing is sitting or crawling and violently shaking/beating/eating whatever is in her little hands&amp;#8230; but that&amp;#8217;s more than enough to keep us watching.</description>

      <description>Most changes are gradual &amp;#8211; including this one&amp;#8230; Poppy is sitting up pretty well now. Over the last two weeks she&amp;#8217;s been getting closet to sitting unaided and most of this week, as long as there&amp;#8217;s a pillow to protect her from occasionally flailing backwards &amp;#8211; she&amp;#8217;s a solid sitter. Amazing how proud I can be over such simple accomplishments.</description>

      <description>Our daughter is 5 months old today. The milestones of time help me take account of the monumental changes which have happened. We have a fully fledged baby &amp;#8211; nobody would call her an infant&amp;#8230; she will never be an infant again.
This is both wonderful and tragic &amp;#8211; but luckily more on the wonderful side.
She&amp;#8217;s starting to teeth occasionally, but it seems to bother her for a couple of days here and there.</description>

      <description>Poppy at Month four:
This month has been quite productive. She has been growing by leaps and bounds, like
normal. She&amp;#8217;s now reaching for everything and
putting it all in her mouth and dropping it on the floor. Nothing is safe within a foot and a half of her. She is sitting up well, if you help her
out. She&amp;#8217;s standing well, if you help her out. I think she is just</description>

      <description>Poppy went swimming for the first time in her cute little two piece + diaper. Mom and Grannie C and Papa all helped keep her afloat. She did great, not always sure she knew what was going on, but was happy and absorbed the new experience without drinking too much chlorinated water. All told, she was probably in the water for almost an hour.</description>

      <description>Update &amp;#8211; we are in Houston for April and May. Staying w/ family and
Anita&amp;#8217;s doing her last rotation at a hospital here. They are kicking
her ass and not even saying sorry&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s the home stretch till
she&amp;#8217;s finally done with school forever! (YAY)
Poppy is big-tastic. She is holding her head up all the time,
laughing a little (when tickled or otherwise super-excited) and smiling
a lot. She&amp;#8217;s almost on a schedule &amp;#8211; which includes 15-30 min of crying</description>

      <description>Penelope has laughed in her sleep and has done some sort-of laughs along the way, but last night, for the first time, she laughed.&amp;nbsp; We got several giggles from her.&amp;nbsp; We were tickling her and of course giggling ourselves, but regardless &amp;#8211; she laughed.&amp;nbsp; We were beside ourselves, as would be expected.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s starting to make some syllable sounds, but it&amp;#8217;s not very far along as of yet.</description>

      <description>The drive to Houston went wonderfully. We did have to stop several
times, but it was just less than what we had prepared for. An 8.5 hour
leg of the trip took 11 hours.
We got to stop in KC and see Karen, Aunt Sue, and Uncle Richard. We
stayed for breakfast and then drove to Gainsville and visited my uncle
Bob. That 7 hour drive took about 10. After staying the night with</description>

      <description>Breast milk contains stem cells &amp;#8211; Monday, 11 February 2008 &amp;#8211; By Catherine Madden
 The Perth scientist who made the world-first discovery that human breast milk contains stem cells is confident that within five years scientists will be harvesting them to research treatment for conditions as far-reaching as spinal injuries, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease.
But what Dr Mark Cregan is excited about right now is the promise that his discovery could be the start of many more exciting revelations about the potency of breast milk.</description>

      <description>Ok &amp;#8211; yeah, she&amp;#8217;s only 15 days old today&amp;#8230; sounds like nothing&amp;#8230; but she is already changing.&amp;nbsp; Her head is getting more solid and her face seems to be solidifying (for want of a better term).
Poppy is getting big.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s still under 10 lbs, but she&amp;#8217;s moving more, making want-to-be-crawling motions when on her belly&amp;#8230; and is more prone to recognize people around her.
She&amp;#8217;s starting to be unhappy when she realizes people aren&amp;#8217;t holding her or at least around her&amp;#8230; but that might not be new &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s just new that people aren&amp;#8217;t always holding her.</description>

      <description>Poppy is doing great &amp;#8211; an absolute joy to have around 95% of the time.&amp;nbsp; She can get fussy sometimes, but it&amp;#8217;s not bad at all &amp;#8211; and she&amp;#8217;s so happy most of the time.
We&amp;#8217;ve gotten better at giving baths and getting dressed and diapering.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve using about 50%/50% cloth and disposable diapers.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;d like to use more cloth, but they really don&amp;#8217;t fit her yet, they are too big.</description>

      <description>My life has shifted. If my perspective on the world were comprised of tectonic plates &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s as if a new continent has formed, replete with earthquakes, tsunamis, and the readjustment of every other piece of the former world. That analogy is poor, because in my case, all these changes are great. Great is an understatement; magnificent is an understatement.
So &amp;#8211; here&amp;#8217;s the short story for those who haven&amp;#8217;t heard it yet.</description>

      <description>Baby Watch Update: 2008.01.23 @ 4pm
Anita&amp;#8217;s been having some serious contraction for a while&amp;#8230; it could be early labor or it could be pre-labor. Even if this isn&amp;#8217;t it, we have an appointment tomorrow morning for induction since Penelope is probably pretty big, and Anita is not (relatively speaking).
So &amp;#8211; tonight or tomorrow.
We&amp;#8217;re at home now and likely to remain here until we&amp;#8217;re convinced she&amp;#8217;s in labor (contractions ~5 min apart for an hour, with a change in activity in between)&amp;#8230; or until tomorrow morning at 9am.</description>

B-day has been great&amp;#8230; a walk in the woods w/ Myra, followed by fantastic sushi lunch and great coffee&amp;#8230; then to work (at work now)&amp;#8230;
The only real complaint I have is that Penelope isn&amp;#8217;t here yet.</description>

however this link informs that the chinese new year really begins on a different date every year based on a lunar calendar. &amp;nbsp;As such: Anita is really a

      <description>Here are the ultrasounds from Anita&amp;#8217;s Dr. visits. Poor quality images all, as they are on some kind of heat-transfer paper they don&amp;#8217;t last, especially not in the heat. That said &amp;#8211; they weren&amp;#8217;t good quality images in the first place.
   
They are neat images though.amazing to see it grow from a bean to a vertebrate in a fairly short period of time. Fingers and toes&amp;#8230; brain and legs.</description>
