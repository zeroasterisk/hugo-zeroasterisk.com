      <description>Best part of CodepaLOUsa so far&amp;#8230; sitting next to Douglas Crockford at dinner tonight. Occasionally I&amp;#8217;m the lucky one. (Hope I didn&amp;#8217;t bore him too much)
Anyway &amp;#8211; having a fun time at CodepaLOUsa and hope all other attendees are too.

      <title>Meteor Core Cordova Support – Alpha Release is out</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2014/08/25/meteor-core-cordova-support-alpha-release-is-out/</link>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve been watching this for a while, but now the first Alpha release is out for Meteor + Cordova built into the core.
SWEET!
Watch the DevShop Presentation on it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzNoXbv1DX4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=24m
&amp;nbsp;
And here are instructions to get it going and play with it: https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Cordova-Z5n6zkVB1xq
&amp;nbsp;
Also, just an update, MeteorRider is still a strong and simple option for getting Meteor into Cordova (DOM hijacking), but I&amp;#8217;m also checking out another great looking option is Cordova Loader (builds all Cordova assets into the public folder of Meteor).</description>

      <title>Testing tools for Old OS &amp; Browser Combos</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2014/05/30/testing-old-os-browser/</link>

      <description>Lots of us have to trace down odd bugs and test things on different browsers and OS combinations&amp;#8230; Of course, the worst of which is &amp;#8220;various versions of IE&amp;#8221; on &amp;#8220;various versions of Windows&amp;#8221;. It seems crazy, but the same version of IE can behave differently on a different version of Windows.
The two best solutions I&amp;#8217;ve used are:
http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools [free, vm locally]
and
http://www.browserstack.com/ [costs, web based]
I just got assigned a crappy bug ticket on IE8 + WinXP and had to dust this off again&amp;#8230; thought I&amp;#8217;d send out a post, see if it helps others and triggers a discussion which might help me out too.</description>

      <title>Great advice from Arunoda “Just Contribute!”</title>

      <description>http://readme.lk/noticed-tech-crowd-interview-arunoda-susiripala/
This advice might be aimed at people who already consider themselves developers, but there&amp;#8217;s a nugget in there that&amp;#8217;s perfect for anyone who is interested in getting started&amp;#8230;
Pick some open-source project, probably a smaller one, that does something you&amp;#8217;re interested in. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and used. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and it didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you looked at and didn&amp;#8217;t understand.</description>

      <description>I had a great time attending and presenting at moscon.
http://mosscon.org/
May 18 &amp;#8211; 19, 2013 | University of Louisville | Louisville, Kentucky
I know it was a lot of work for the people who set it up, but you did a great job and I look forward to attending again in another year.
(if I present again next time, my slides will be more readable, I promise&amp;#8230;)</description>

      <title>I’m just Git’ting it</title>

      <description>Everyone and their mom have been using Git and GitHub for a while, but I&amp;#8217;m just breaking down and using it&amp;#8230; I have been slow to adopt because SVN worked for me fine (until I had to merge branches) and I don&amp;#8217;t like to pay for storage space. But I continue to be impressed by it&amp;#8217;s functionality and ease of use, so I&amp;#8217;m going to move our work repositories over (needing a Large account probably) but I think it will be worth it.</description>

      <title>CakePHP beforeSave() gotcha: need to set $this-&gt;__exists to true if setting a primary key</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2010/02/18/cakephp-beforesave-gotcha-this-__exists/</link>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2010/02/18/cakephp-beforesave-gotcha-this-__exists/</guid>
      <description>I added an update to CakePHP Book: beforeSave()
 Also, if you add a primary key which would turn an &amp;#8220;insert&amp;#8221; into an &amp;#8220;update&amp;#8221; within beforeSave() you&amp;#8217;ll need to set $this-&amp;gt;__exists = true;&amp;#8230; the call to $this-&amp;gt;exists(); happens in model.php before the callback to beforeSave().
function beforeSave() { if (!isset($this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isset($this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;unique_field&#39;])) { $found = $this-&amp;gt;find(&#34;first&#34;,array( &#34;recursive&#34; =&amp;gt; -1, &#34;fields&#34; =&amp;gt; array(&#34;id&#34;), &#34;conditions&#34; =&amp;gt; array(&#34;unique_field&#34; =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;unique_field&#39;]))); if (!empty($found) &amp;&amp; isset($found[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;])) { $this-&amp;gt;id = $this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;] = $found[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;]; $this-&amp;gt;__exists = true; } } return parent::beforeSave(); }  That&amp;#8217;s been confusing me a bit recently &amp;#8211; setting the ID of a row within beforesave() should change the save to an update, but it was trying to insert with a specified ID and thus, failing&amp;#8230; glad to have a simple solution that makes sense&amp;#8230; hope that helps someone else&amp;#8230;</description>

      <title>MySQL Master/Slave Replication Monitoring PHP Script</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2010/01/13/mysql-masterslave-replication-monitoring-php-script/</link>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2010/01/13/mysql-masterslave-replication-monitoring-php-script/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a bit proud of myself on this one&amp;#8230; I setup a simple, but clean and configurable, MySQL Master/Slave Replication Monitoring PHP Script:
http://code.google.com/p/php-mysql-master-slave-replication-monitor/ (docs)
It&amp;#8217;s Open Source and free, I welcome comments, suggestions, and questions.
I think this will be quite useful for anyone who is setting up a pair of MySQL servers as master/slave and want to be sure their replication works as it should.

      <title>SVN Merge, making sure a branch is updated from trunk, then merging back to trunk</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2009/03/05/svn-merge-making-sure-a-branch-is-updated-from-trunk-then-merging-back-to-trunk/</link>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2009/03/05/svn-merge-making-sure-a-branch-is-updated-from-trunk-then-merging-back-to-trunk/</guid>
      <description>So I&amp;#8217;ve just fought a battle w/ SVN merge and thought I&amp;#8217;d post the solution in case others might find it&amp;#8230;
Scenario
Our stable code is in trunk svn://svn.domain.tld/repository/trunk
I&amp;#8217;ve got a branch of trunk svn://svn.domain.tld/repository/branches/dev
Changes have been made to my branch and changes have been made to trunk, since I branched.
I&amp;#8217;m ready to merge my branch back into trunk.
Approach / Overview
Basically, to be safe, I need to first update my branch with the changes from trunk and resolve any conflicts.</description>

      <title>Mantis to Basecamp to-do(s)</title>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/11/13/mantis-to-basecamp-to-dos/</guid>
      <description>I just created a handy little script to create todos in basecamp for unresovled tickets in mantis.
You can see the open sourced code/project: http://code.google.com/p/mantis2basecamp-todo/.
This is something we found useful, if you use both tools, you might find it useful as well.
