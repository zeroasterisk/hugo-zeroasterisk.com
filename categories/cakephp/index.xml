      <title>CakePHP beforeSave() gotcha: need to set $this-&gt;__exists to true if setting a primary key</title>

      <description>I added an update to CakePHP Book: beforeSave()
 Also, if you add a primary key which would turn an &amp;#8220;insert&amp;#8221; into an &amp;#8220;update&amp;#8221; within beforeSave() you&amp;#8217;ll need to set $this-&amp;gt;__exists = true;&amp;#8230; the call to $this-&amp;gt;exists(); happens in model.php before the callback to beforeSave().
function beforeSave() { if (!isset($this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isset($this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;unique_field&#39;])) { $found = $this-&amp;gt;find(&#34;first&#34;,array( &#34;recursive&#34; =&amp;gt; -1, &#34;fields&#34; =&amp;gt; array(&#34;id&#34;), &#34;conditions&#34; =&amp;gt; array(&#34;unique_field&#34; =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;unique_field&#39;]))); if (!empty($found) &amp;&amp; isset($found[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;])) { $this-&amp;gt;id = $this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;] = $found[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;]; $this-&amp;gt;__exists = true; } } return parent::beforeSave(); }  That&amp;#8217;s been confusing me a bit recently &amp;#8211; setting the ID of a row within beforesave() should change the save to an update, but it was trying to insert with a specified ID and thus, failing&amp;#8230; glad to have a simple solution that makes sense&amp;#8230; hope that helps someone else&amp;#8230;</description>

      <title>DarkAuth for the win!</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working with CakePHP for a few years now and am very happy with it. I&amp;#8217;ve been working with the 1.2 version for a few months (since it went stable) and playing with the Auth and ACL core components.
I&amp;#8217;ve decided that ACL is too complicated for most setups, and Auth is fine, but not perfect. So after some research, I switched to the DarkAuth component, which was much better suited to my needs.</description>

      <title>A CakePHP gotcha for migrating from 1.1 to 1.2&#43; on Model-&gt;create()</title>

      <description>I reported this as a ticket, but as it turns out, it&amp;#8217;s a design choice.. but it&amp;#8217;s enough of a gotcha that I thought I should report it.
What happened The $this-&amp;gt;ModelName-&amp;gt;create() set the defaults for the next save, which is what I would expect. But on my database there&amp;#8217;s a default value set for the &amp;#8216;created&amp;#8217; field (the standard for datetime columns in PHPmyAdmin) as well as the &amp;#8216;modified&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;updated&amp;#8217; fields.</description>

      <description>So here I am, in Raleigh, NC &amp;#8211; waiting for the CakePHP Workshop to start&amp;#8230; We survived the rain so far, waiting to see if there is any flooding or whatnot.
Have met a few people here so far, all seem very friendly. Looking forward to seeing what happens and what we learn along the way.
I am wearing my &amp;#8220;I [heart] LAMP&amp;#8221; geek-shirt today, as it seemed appropriate (if a little over the top nerdy).</description>
