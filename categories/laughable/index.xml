      <description>A very funny post for the programming nerds out there:
If programming languages were religions&amp;#8230;

 PHP would be Cafeteria Christianity &amp;#8211; Fights with Java for the web market. It draws a few concepts from C and Java, but only those that it really likes. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s not as coherent as other languages, but at least it leaves you with much more freedom and ostensibly keeps the core idea of the whole thing.</description>

      <description>One sunny day in 2009 an old man approached the White House
from across Pennsylvania Avenue, where he&amp;#8217;d been sitting on a
park bench. He spoke to the U.S. Marine standing guard and
said, &amp;#8216;I would like to go in and meet with President Bush.&amp;#8217;
The Marine looked at the man and said, &amp;#8216;Sir, Mr. Bush is no longer
president and no longer resides here.&amp;#8217;
The old man said, &amp;#8216;Okay, thank you&amp;#8217; and walked away.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s long, but great &amp;#8211; go read the Nerd Handbook and understand your favorite nerds just a bit more. &amp;nbsp;Here&amp;#8217;s a quote from the top:
 Understand your nerd’s relation to the computer. It’s clichéd, but a nerd is defined by his computer, and you need to understand why.
First, a majority of the folks on the planet either have no idea how
a computer works or they look at it and think “it’s magic”.</description>

I also found his youtube profile, with some other video&amp;#8217;s I&amp;#8217;m not yet familiar with&amp;#8230; researching&amp;#8230;.

      <description>This video involves a not-so-subtle analogy&amp;#8230;. I give it a clever rating of 3.8 stars (out of 5), but I liked it enough to post.

      <description>Five questions that will dictate your personality for the rest of your life.
 I don&amp;#8217;t get it. It&amp;#8217;s like those people who go around with those t-shirts and stickers that say &amp;#8220;you laugh at me because I&amp;#8217;m different, but I laugh at you because you&amp;#8217;re all the same.&amp;#8221; How different are you if you&amp;#8217;re wearing a mass-produced t-shirt with a registered trade mark sold through one of the largest clothing franchises in the world?</description>

      <description>YouTube &amp;#8211; White and Nerdy- Weird Al
This video/song is fantastic&amp;#8230; it hits pretty close to home for me and several of my friends, though. Personally it&amp;#8217;s hitting at least 40% acurate for me:
I&amp;#8217;m fluent in Javascript, do webpages for friends, got a friend who went to MIT, have stationary rims, i&amp;#8217;ve got a soldering gun, i edit wikipedia, i can quote the whole &amp;#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&amp;#8221;, and I wanna bowl with the gansta&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>Challenged by Creationists, Museums Answer Back
(sorry, the link requires login)
Apparently, after a few rather agressive (not phiscally) confrontations with creationists, in science museums &amp;#8211; docents and volunteers are flocking to training on how to best respond to such challenges.
&amp;#8220;The goal is to understand the controversies, so that people are better able to handle them as they come up,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;Museums, as a field, have recognized we need to take a more proactive role in evolution education.</description>
