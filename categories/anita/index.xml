      <description>Oliver has been feeling a bit sick for a couple of days, and it was acute yesterday early afternoon &amp;#8211; he was doing the &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m in pain&amp;#8221; cry for a half an hour straight and was inconsolable. Very unusual for him. So we made an appointment to see the Pediatrician and by the time we got in there (~3 hours later) he seemed pretty normal, though really tired still because he is sick and doing all the extra crying, but sleeping and eating ok again.</description>

      <description>Most of you have heard from the grapevine or facebook (this generation&amp;#8217;s grapevine) that our son, Oliver Jackson Blount, was born on 2010-02-02 @ 14:35 EST. He was 9 pounds 15 ounces and 23 inches (they measured twice to be sure).
We had a home birth with 2 midwives and an apprentice, a doula, Anita&amp;#8217;s mom (former NICU nurse) and sister Virginia (new nurse) in attendance&amp;#8230; of yeah, and me. The decision to have a home birth was one we took very seriously and subsequently are very happy with; it being unusual is often the topic of conversation&amp;#8230; but I can summarize with the following: We had a normal and healthy fetus inside a normal and healthy mom, everything looking like it would progress as &amp;#8220;low risk&amp;#8221; we choose to stay at home with the support of professionals vs.</description>

      <description>Mom and Sam drove to Louisville for a few days this past weekend+ (Friday &amp;#8211; Tuesday).
We all had a wonderful visit and they played with poppy almost nonstop&amp;#8230; as expected. We took full advantage of the free babysitting and went out a few nights and on the whole, were less than adequate hosts, but they didn&amp;#8217;t seem to mind.
Mom&amp;#8217;s posted her photos here, and below is a slideshow</description>

      <description>Scott and Tami had a wonderful wedding in Columbus in late fall 2008. We went with Poppy and my mom Cathy. At the wedding they had a photobooth set up and some of the photos went into a scrapbook and some we took home&amp;#8230; here are the took home ones.</description>

      <description>We went to Houston this year, for Poppy&amp;#8217;s first Christmas and spent almost a week with my family.&amp;nbsp; Everyone loved and was amazed by Poppy, of course and she did splendidly.&amp;nbsp; She traveled quite well, sleeping for the first part of both flights and playing quietly for the second.&amp;nbsp; She also did a remarkably good job dealing with all the people she didn&amp;#8217;t really know and the back and forth craziness of going from house to house to house.</description>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/12/17/we-refinanced-our-mortgage-today/</guid>
      <description>We have refinanced (or at least started the process) and locked in at 4.96 after paying a point (it was 5.6 without the point, lenders wanting up-front money and assurance in today&amp;#8217;s market). We are rolling in the point and closing costs into the new loan and we&amp;#8217;ll still be saving $140/month over our current loan (and if we hadn&amp;#8217;t rolled in the costs, it would only have saved us $21/month more).</description>

      <description>We were talking about this recently and we realized that in the past two years:     We have&amp;nbsp;lived in 5 different places (our apt in Columbus, Anita&amp;#8217;s mom&amp;#8217;s for a few months, Chili&amp;#8217;s house for almost a year, Houston with my family for a couple of months, and finally our new house)     I have&amp;nbsp;worked 6 positions in 3 companies, not counting consulting gigs on the side.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve finally processed and uploaded the photos from my camera.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve got new ones from september, october, and november.&amp;nbsp; Most are of Poppy, but not all of them.&amp;nbsp; Some great halloween photos, some camping, and many other occasions where the camera was brought out.

      <description>An email from my Mom who recently visited us. It&amp;#8217;s a great recap and update on Poppy, so I&amp;#8217;m just pasting in here:
 I recommend becoming a grandmother &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the best! I have just returned from a week in Louisville with Alan and Anita&amp;#8230;and Poppy, which included two Halloween parties, a wedding in Columbus, a long walk in Iroquois park to check out the fall colors, two swimming lessons for Poppy (with Anita), and progress made on Poppy&amp;#8217;s room mural by my good friend, Joan Firster and me.</description>

      <description>We went for Poppy&amp;#8217;s nine month old check up today and she is starting to slim down and lengthen. At her 7month visit, she was 19lbs and 27.5inches, and now she is holding steady at 19lbs and up to 29inches. There were no vaccines today &amp;#8211; woohoo!
After her visit and a good nap, we were playing downstairs and she took her first preliminary, wobbly steps. It was just 2-3 steps a time or 2, but it was pretty amazing.</description>

      <description>Saturday night we got back home and were amazed to see lights on.&amp;nbsp; LG&amp;amp;E rigged up some scary looking connections across downed lines (we will not go walking on stilts), but they got our block light up&amp;#8230; faster than I expected.
We were without power for right at a week, and it certainly could have been much worse.&amp;nbsp; We had no damage and no monetary loss (except the food in the fridge/freezer).</description>

      <description>Anita has been going to school for her whole life. She&amp;#8217;s 28, and she&amp;#8217;s gone to school k-12, and then college for 9 years after that. She got her PharmD from OSU and became a Dr. of Pharmacy&amp;#8230; but all of that is for naught without passing a national board and a state law board.
Well &amp;#8211; she&amp;#8217;s passed both on her first attempt and is now, a bonafide (licensed) Pharmacist.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve gone for 72 hours without checking my email or getting online. Wonders will never cease.
We&amp;#8217;ve been finishing up packing and moving into our new house!
As such &amp;#8211; things are of course &amp;#8211; crazy and i&amp;#8217;m beaten down (in fact, I
might have very very mild heat stroke) &amp;#8211; but we&amp;#8217;re both really happy to

      <description>We have made an offer on 183 Coral Ave. and it was accepted (finally).
You may have heard about the problems we had with the last house we were interested in, so were were trying not to get our hopes up too much &amp;#8211; but now we are signed and contracted&amp;#8230; good to go.
The house is big enough with a little expansion room in the basement, across the street from a great park and on an almost double lot.</description>

      <description>We had gotten VERY excited about a house we were going to buy.
We made an offer, they countered, we accepted&amp;#8230; all today (Sunday). We were waiting on the counter-offer-paperwork to sign and send back&amp;#8230; well, instead of getting that, we actually got notified that the offer was retracted. Someone else made a better offer and we weren&amp;#8217;t given an option to bid back.
Of course, this was after we&amp;#8217;d told everyone and after we&amp;#8217;d gotten really, really excited about this house.</description>

This month has been quite productive. She has been growing by leaps and bounds, like
normal. She&amp;#8217;s now reaching for everything and
putting it all in her mouth and dropping it on the floor. Nothing is safe within a foot and a half of her. She is sitting up well, if you help her
out. She&amp;#8217;s standing well, if you help her out. I think she is just</description>

      <description>we had a date last night (our first in 6+ months) and ate Ethiopian food and watched &amp;#8220;Iron Man&amp;#8220;. Both the food and the movie were fantastic!
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because we haven&amp;#8217;t really had a night to ourselves in a while; maybe it&amp;#8217;s because we haven&amp;#8217;t seen a movie in a few months&amp;#8230; but we both loved every second of our date and I personally will be re watching iron man a few times.</description>

      <description>Poppy went swimming for the first time in her cute little two piece + diaper. Mom and Grannie C and Papa all helped keep her afloat. She did great, not always sure she knew what was going on, but was happy and absorbed the new experience without drinking too much chlorinated water. All told, she was probably in the water for almost an hour.</description>

      <description>Update &amp;#8211; we are in Houston for April and May. Staying w/ family and
Anita&amp;#8217;s doing her last rotation at a hospital here. They are kicking
her ass and not even saying sorry&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s the home stretch till
she&amp;#8217;s finally done with school forever! (YAY)
Poppy is big-tastic. She is holding her head up all the time,
laughing a little (when tickled or otherwise super-excited) and smiling
a lot. She&amp;#8217;s almost on a schedule &amp;#8211; which includes 15-30 min of crying</description>

times, but it was just less than what we had prepared for. An 8.5 hour
leg of the trip took 11 hours.
We got to stop in KC and see Karen, Aunt Sue, and Uncle Richard. We
stayed for breakfast and then drove to Gainsville and visited my uncle
Bob. That 7 hour drive took about 10. After staying the night with</description>

      <description>My life has shifted. If my perspective on the world were comprised of tectonic plates &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s as if a new continent has formed, replete with earthquakes, tsunamis, and the readjustment of every other piece of the former world. That analogy is poor, because in my case, all these changes are great. Great is an understatement; magnificent is an understatement.
So &amp;#8211; here&amp;#8217;s the short story for those who haven&amp;#8217;t heard it yet.</description>

      <description>Baby Watch Update: 2008.01.23 @ 4pm
Anita&amp;#8217;s been having some serious contraction for a while&amp;#8230; it could be early labor or it could be pre-labor. Even if this isn&amp;#8217;t it, we have an appointment tomorrow morning for induction since Penelope is probably pretty big, and Anita is not (relatively speaking).
So &amp;#8211; tonight or tomorrow.
We&amp;#8217;re at home now and likely to remain here until we&amp;#8217;re convinced she&amp;#8217;s in labor (contractions ~5 min apart for an hour, with a change in activity in between)&amp;#8230; or until tomorrow morning at 9am.</description>

      <description>Anita and I went to the Dr. and got the latests baby-weight&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s 31 pounds.&amp;nbsp; That takes the pregnancy weight from ~20% to ~25% of her previous body weight.&amp;nbsp;
A picture&amp;#8217;s worth 1000 words&amp;#8230; and I&amp;#8217;m wouldn&amp;#8217;t write that much anyway, but here are some pictures to prove my point:

      <description>Hello everyone.&amp;nbsp; We like to do things a bit latter&amp;#8230;
you know, catch the after Christmas sales and have more time to
prepare.&amp;nbsp; This year that philosophy also extends to Christmas cards and
in this case, emails.
The year of 2007
January of 2007 Alan&amp;#8217;s team got outsourced to Singapore and he found a new job working for friends doing web development.&amp;nbsp; Alan also picked up a contracting job which ended up being part-time which ended up being his new full time job this November.</description>

      <description>A good and busy Christmas this year.&amp;nbsp; We stayed in Louisville because Anita&amp;#8217;s too close to due-date to travel.&amp;nbsp; Had 7 different family engagements in two days and enjoyed every one&amp;#8230; though at the end of things we are certainly tired.&amp;nbsp; We had too much food and too much sugar, enough sleep and a great amount of fun.

however this link informs that the chinese new year really begins on a different date every year based on a lunar calendar. &amp;nbsp;As such: Anita is really a

      <description>Anita and Alan and Cathy (Alan&amp;#8217;s mom) visit Chris and Jenny Parker in the hospital ~2 days after the birth of Emmalynn Parker.
  more&amp;#8230;
This was a &amp;#8220;scary&amp;#8221; birth story.&amp;nbsp; After 7-8 hours of early/active labor, everything normal and in the Hospital&amp;#8230; the baby monitor showed significantly decreasing heartrate.&amp;nbsp; Chris hit the &amp;#8220;call nurse&amp;#8221; button about the same time as 4 nurses ran into the room and moved Jenny around.</description>

      <description>Everyone seems to be gearing up for the baby-shower.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;m sure its going to be rife with &amp;#8220;ooohh&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;awww&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;isn&amp;#8217;t that
cute&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; Typically I&amp;#8217;m pretty easygoing about such things, but in this
case, I&amp;#8217;m glad it&amp;#8217;s a woman-only-affair.&amp;nbsp;
That said, Anita is surprising herself with how into the whole affair she is becoming.&amp;nbsp; Those hormones are potent, it seems.
To all friends who were not invited&amp;#8230; guess what&amp;#8230; no friends were.</description>

      <description>Here are some fun pictures of Anita and Penelope. She&amp;#8217;s now 7 months pregnant and starting to get a bit un-comfortably pregnant. Parts of her fall asleep without reasonable cause. Getting up is more of a challenge than it&amp;#8217;s ever been before. Penelope is kicking most of the time, sometime flipping around and keeping things interesting&amp;#8230; occasionally kicking down &amp;#8211; apparently very painful, that.</description>

      <description>This is about the best news ever.&amp;nbsp; (my stomach thinks so)
We just heard about this today, and went to Maido&amp;#8217;s (in Louisville, KY &amp;#8211; map)&amp;#8230;. it was absolutely fantastic!
For less than $9, you get to pick over some of the best Japanese food in Louisville.&amp;nbsp; As of now, it&amp;#8217;s only been open for lunch for about a week and there were few people there.&amp;nbsp; So go quick.
I suspect when word of this gets out, it will either stop or get ridiculously busy.</description>

      <description>Here are the ultrasounds from Anita&amp;#8217;s Dr. visits. Poor quality images all, as they are on some kind of heat-transfer paper they don&amp;#8217;t last, especially not in the heat. That said &amp;#8211; they weren&amp;#8217;t good quality images in the first place.
   
They are neat images though.amazing to see it grow from a bean to a vertebrate in a fairly short period of time. Fingers and toes&amp;#8230; brain and legs.</description>

      <description>After several years of marriage and putting off having kids till we were more financially stable&amp;#8230; we are now pregnant. Due in Jan. or Feb. 2008. We have no data, but &amp;#8220;think&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s going to be a girl&amp;#8230;
Apparently, a few days ago, anita woke up from an amazingly realistic dream where she was holding &amp;#8220;our baby girl&amp;#8221;. We didn&amp;#8217;t really think she was pregnant but after the dream, she had to take a pregnancy test and it turns out we are.</description>

Anita&amp;#8217;s birthday was great. I drove her to get coffee and then to school. I picked up lunch and delivered it. School actually got cancelled early today (unheard of here). We hung out and watched Battlestar Gallactica for a while and then went to eat at the Surly Girl with some good friends.</description>

      <description>I need some help from some people who understand finances better than I do, am I getting ripped off of a cent a month interest by my bank? (earth shattering importance, of course)
Imagine the following (hypothetical) savings account earning 1% annual interest. 1% annual is (0.01 / 365) 0.000027397260274 daily interest. So for every day, you multiply the amount of money you have accruing interest by that daily amount&amp;#8230; add the days together and you&amp;#8217;ve got your interest amount for that length of days&amp;#8230; when your money amount changes (when you add to it or reduce it) your calculations change, so you need to reflect that&amp;#8230; a basic table is displayed below&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>[Anita&amp;#8217;s new wedding ring (the 3rd)]1
This is the 3rd wedding rind on Anita&amp;#8217;s finger&amp;#8230; all 3 from Alan, and all within the first 5-6 years of marriage. Luckily all three of them together are less than many people pay for one&amp;#8230; this weighing in fairly high on the price list at ~$170&amp;#8230; we purchased it from Donald R. Pekarek, the jeweler/goldsmith/artist who made it. He was at a local art fair a couple of weeks ago, here in Columbus and though we were not really in the market, decided that it seemed very Anita&amp;#8217;ish and she wanted to have a ring again&amp;#8230;.</description>

[map] First, we drove to and camped at the Hot Springs National Park, during the hottest part of a heat wave.&amp;nbsp; Our A/C could occasionally not keep up, it was so hot&amp;#8230; so when we ended up at the park, we went wading (which turned into swimming for some) in a creek that ran through the park.</description>

Before we got there we swung by the Jim Beam plant (thinking it was where Myra did a bunch of cool carpentry work, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t) and then the Bernheim Forrest. Bernheim has always been a great place to get back to nature a bit, but it&amp;#8217;s gotten a lot nicer&amp;#8230; the visitor&amp;#8217;s center is amazing, and all the displays and trails we saw, were flawless.</description>

We got a Sealy : Reflexion : Venice Beach &amp;#8211; a big latext foam bed. We bought it at us-matress.com, but we only had to buy the mattres (no box spring) so it ended up being a less than what you see as the cost.</description>

      <description>Before we went to Houston, Anita and I spent some time in Louisville.
We were able to see some friends and a good amount of family. We missed out on the big family events, as we were in Houston then&amp;#8230; but we still got to play some games and relax and eat and all the basic events of together-hood.
I worked in the Louisville office, but because most people weren&amp;#8217;t there, I was able to get more work done than I usually do when I go into the office&amp;#8230; but still less than I can get done at home&amp;#8230; weird, huh?</description>

      <description>I spent many full and well populated days in Houston. Anita and I spent nights at various family houses, ate some of the best food we had eaten all year, and most importantly &amp;#8211; got to spend good time with our family together.
Here are some of the highlights:
 Great quality time with family (can&amp;#8217;t mention it enough &amp;#8211; strange that just spending time is so important, so simple, and so rare) Got to meet Scott&amp;#8217;s girlfriend, Ilah (ee-lah) Good but sad visits with my grandmother [Penny]1 Games played : rummykub, canasta, hearts, pictionary, balderdash, ping pong (I won at ping-pong and sometime I won at canasta, but lost everything else) Food, food, and food (including some mango salsa I made, which everyone appeared to appreciate) Ikea blitz &amp;#8211; a 1 hour run through ikea resulting in a total bill of less than $150 for Anita and myself (incredible for us consumer sheep)  One of the important parts which gets a bit of a review is my visit with my grandmother &amp;#8220;Penny&amp;#8221;, who has Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>So, when flying to Houston, early on Monday the 19th of December I ran into a slight problem.
I went through security without issue, and my laptop bag had to go through&amp;#8230; and I overheard security people being called over, waited, and heard a couple of other security people being called over. About this time I get nervous and soon overhear something I would rather not have heard.
Apparently, I had forgotten that I had put some gifts in my laptop bag, that I got for people at work in Japan&amp;#8230; They were very unimpressive, unassuming, decoration-only, ummm, throwing stars.</description>

      <description>We are getting our stuff together to leave columbus for a while. We have house-sitters / cat-sitters for the majority of the time we are gone&amp;#8230; and we are bringing Nova with us, to Louisville.
We are also bringing Ginni&amp;#8217;s queen sized mattress (strapped to the roof of the CRV with ratchet-straps and bungies). That will make for a slightly slower drive, but shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too bad (I hope). In addition, it will be Anita, Alan, John, and Nova in the car with a few weeks worth of stuff for all.</description>

      <description>The past week (starting at the end of last week actually) Anita and I have been insufferably busy. I&amp;#8217;ve been working till midnight or later Sat-Wed&amp;#8230; anita has, if anything, been working more&amp;#8230; studying for finals and taking finals.
Luckily, the fires at my work seem to be more under control and Anita is, as of today, done with her tests&amp;#8230; She of course doesn&amp;#8217;t know her results, but I&amp;#8217;m sure she&amp;#8217;s doing fine&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Here is my requisite turkeyday post. Anita had to work her last day today, so we are in Columbus still. She plans on not working until this summer. I&amp;#8217;ve been encouraging her to do this&amp;#8230; though her ~10 hours of work a week doesn&amp;#8217;t sound like much, since she does ~60 hours a week of school work &amp;#8211; a few extra hours to relax would be welcome.
We will be driving to Louisville tonight after anita is off work.</description>

      <description>Pre-Halloween Party : Hell House II
Well, as with pretty much all DJ Foursquare (and hushabye house) parties, this was a great event. Chill people, great crowd, good venue (effective at least), great music, etc&amp;#8230; It also benifited from a great collection of costumes and a very moderate and (sorry for this review) disney-land-like bondage show&amp;#8230; Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t think the crew was disney-land&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure they had to weak-i-fy their setup/show for the audience invovled.</description>

      <description>I just took a Typology Test and ended up as ENFJ which broke down as the following:
 [17%] Extroverted [25%] Intuitive [12%] Feeling [67%] Judging  You can read more about the ENFJ type by looking at the following descriptions&amp;hellip; one by D.Keirsey&amp;nbsp;and one by J. Butt.
Update &amp;#8211; Oct. 11
I found out that according to the Typology tests, the perfect match for ENFJ is ISFJ, and Anita is who got me to take the test&amp;#8230; So, I had to find out what her type was&amp;#8230; and of coruse, she&amp;#8217;s ISFJ.</description>

      <description>Saturday Anita had to work, but Phil, Sarah, Jess, and Phil&amp;rsquo;s friend Tom came over and played Mao&amp;nbsp;1.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s a great game &amp;ndash; and surprisingly effective at bringing about a represive dictatorial feel in the players (who thought that could be so much fun?).&amp;nbsp;
We played a variant where after winning 3 rounds you could make up your own rule&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; my personal favorite was (my rule): you have to use rapper hands whenever you call penalty on someone.</description>

      <description>I took the kittens to the vet yesterday. It turns out they&amp;#8217;re only 6 weeks old and they are both males. We have also decided on names for them. The black one is henceforth Thebe, and the white and orange one is Io. These are the names of 2 of Jupiter&amp;#8217;s moons, so we were able to stick with the science theme afterall!</description>

      <description>We have kittens.

That&amp;#8217;s right, it&amp;#8217;s cute-fest-2005 in our apartment right now. We got a pair of 8 6 week old kittens on Sunday from Anita&amp;#8217;s co-worker who got them dumped on her by her mom. They are a brother (black) and sister (white &amp;amp; orange) and have very quickly bonded with Anita and I&amp;#8230; they are ok with Nova, but she&amp;#8217;s not yet ok with them. Nova actually submitted to them, belly up and looking away; our guard dog proving her grit once again.</description>

      <description>Anita and I were planning on staying up all Monday night and going to the Tokyo Fish Market at 5 am on Tuesday, but around 3am we crashed. Anita got up at 4:30 and fully intended to get me up, but she saw that a sub-tropical-storm was headed at Tokyo and that it was already raining pretty hard… There’s something about being dog tired and lost in a city that is much worse sounding if you add in the attribute &amp;#8211; rain soaked.</description>

      <description>After the late night before, we all slept in… Anita and I slept in so much we missed our hotel’s breakfast. We found a snack and took the subway to the Tokyo Aquarium. It was totally disappointing. The animals had very small enclosures, particularly bothersome were the mammals. There were many dead or dirty exhibits and not too much to read in English… We left after (something like) an hour and a half and roamed the “Sunshine 60” shopping complex (basically a big mall like the galleria in Houston without the ice skating rink).</description>

      <description>Another morning of repacking, a walk to the station, and a train ride to Tokyo (~3 hours)… most people napped (I read).
 We got out at Tokyo and took a subway to the hotel, dropped off our packs, and walked around to find food. Ironically, our hotel was right next to Akihabara, the Electronic Market in Tokyo, and it was Sunday, a day so busy the street is shut down to vehicles and the area is swarmed with geeks of all varieties and the people that feed on/off them.</description>

      <description>On our second full day in Kyoto we ate the last of the Fruit and some of the granola bars for breakfast; then we hopped on the #100 bus for the east side of Kyoto to see Ginkakuji-michi (the Silver Temple). The Silver Temple was much better than the Golden Temple because it was less overrun with tourists and also because the surrounding gardens were amazing. The cultivation of moss is, itself, remarkable, but to see the whole garden come together is quite impressive.</description>

      <description>We got an early start, showered, dressed, and set out for the train station to buy bus passes before 8:00 am. 2,000 Yen for a 2 day all bus all subway pass is a good deal… also because it means you don’t have to pay attention to which company bus or subway you want to use, because in the city of Kyoto there are at least 3-4 different companies for public transit and most other passes don’t cover them all.</description>

      <description>We finished packing for a couple of hours and then took way too much stuff down to the Koori-Machi train station. We caught the 15 minute train to Fukushima and stuffed our packs into lockers at the train station there. (Except my pack, which wouldn’t fit in any of the lockers)
We then went to the 100 Yen store – the Japanese equivalent of the $1.00 store, but much, much cooler.</description>

      <description>Wednesday, we went to the elementary school April visits a few times a week. We did a brief tour of the classes and had an audience with the principal and vice-principal. The school seemed wonderful, but we didn’t have as much time to spend there as we did in Jo-Chu. We had to rush through the school, stop for a quick Ramen lunch, and be back at April’s apartment in time for Karen to receive a several wonderful gifts from some of April’s students who were in Elizabethtown last year.</description>

      <description>Tuesday 19 July 2005, we dressed in our nice clothes, carried our own house slippers so we didn’t have to use visitor slippers, and walked to Jo-Ho Chugakko Junior High School, known as Jo-Chu. Arriving at school a few minutes early (which was really on time) we met with the principal (Coach O’Sensei). Immediately we were amazed with how generous he was&amp;#8230; treating us like honored guests would be putting it mildly.</description>

      <description>This morning we ate fruit, cereal, and granola before setting out for Mount Azuma. We took the Aizu Bandi Skyline (highway) for some beautiful but quite frightening driving in the mountains. A couple hours of hair-pin turns and sulfur smelling air later, we ended up at Mount Azuma. It’s a large (dormant?) volcano crater in the midst of a gorgeous mountain range. We walked around the crater, against some very serious winds.</description>

      <description>Saturday we took a local train to Fukushima and ate lunch at our first Japanese restaurant&amp;#8230; it was spectacular! It was a friend of a friend&amp;#8217;s dad&amp;#8217;s restaurant and we ended up being there 20 minutes before they opened, but they let us in and sat us by the window looking out onto their wonderful and very small garden. We had pork medallions and miso and cabbage salads and rice &amp;#8211; I had a curry dish.</description>

      <description>24 hours, is a long time to travel.
We flew to Chicago from Louisville, but got delayed on the runway in Louisville; so we had to run in Chicago to make it to our connecting flight to Tokyo&amp;#8230; we made it though, and started our ~11.5 hour flight.
The plane ride was fine, in that really long and tiring kinda way. We were good and stayed awake (mostly) in order to sync our sleep cycle with Japan which is almost exactly the opposite of our timezone.</description>
