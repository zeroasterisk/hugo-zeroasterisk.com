      <description>Breast milk contains stem cells &amp;#8211; Monday, 11 February 2008 &amp;#8211; By Catherine Madden
 The Perth scientist who made the world-first discovery that human breast milk contains stem cells is confident that within five years scientists will be harvesting them to research treatment for conditions as far-reaching as spinal injuries, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease.
But what Dr Mark Cregan is excited about right now is the promise that his discovery could be the start of many more exciting revelations about the potency of breast milk.</description>

      <description>My life has shifted. If my perspective on the world were comprised of tectonic plates &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s as if a new continent has formed, replete with earthquakes, tsunamis, and the readjustment of every other piece of the former world. That analogy is poor, because in my case, all these changes are great. Great is an understatement; magnificent is an understatement.
So &amp;#8211; here&amp;#8217;s the short story for those who haven&amp;#8217;t heard it yet.</description>

      <description>Baby Watch Update: 2008.01.23 @ 4pm
Anita&amp;#8217;s been having some serious contraction for a while&amp;#8230; it could be early labor or it could be pre-labor. Even if this isn&amp;#8217;t it, we have an appointment tomorrow morning for induction since Penelope is probably pretty big, and Anita is not (relatively speaking).
So &amp;#8211; tonight or tomorrow.
We&amp;#8217;re at home now and likely to remain here until we&amp;#8217;re convinced she&amp;#8217;s in labor (contractions ~5 min apart for an hour, with a change in activity in between)&amp;#8230; or until tomorrow morning at 9am.</description>

      <description>Anita and Alan and Cathy (Alan&amp;#8217;s mom) visit Chris and Jenny Parker in the hospital ~2 days after the birth of Emmalynn Parker.
  more&amp;#8230;
This was a &amp;#8220;scary&amp;#8221; birth story.&amp;nbsp; After 7-8 hours of early/active labor, everything normal and in the Hospital&amp;#8230; the baby monitor showed significantly decreasing heartrate.&amp;nbsp; Chris hit the &amp;#8220;call nurse&amp;#8221; button about the same time as 4 nurses ran into the room and moved Jenny around.</description>

      <title>Anita’s Baby Shower: codename pre-penelope (2007.12.09)</title>

      <description>Everyone seems to be gearing up for the baby-shower.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;m sure its going to be rife with &amp;#8220;ooohh&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;awww&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;isn&amp;#8217;t that
cute&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; Typically I&amp;#8217;m pretty easygoing about such things, but in this
case, I&amp;#8217;m glad it&amp;#8217;s a woman-only-affair.&amp;nbsp;
That said, Anita is surprising herself with how into the whole affair she is becoming.&amp;nbsp; Those hormones are potent, it seems.
To all friends who were not invited&amp;#8230; guess what&amp;#8230; no friends were.</description>

      <description>Here are some fun pictures of Anita and Penelope. She&amp;#8217;s now 7 months pregnant and starting to get a bit un-comfortably pregnant. Parts of her fall asleep without reasonable cause. Getting up is more of a challenge than it&amp;#8217;s ever been before. Penelope is kicking most of the time, sometime flipping around and keeping things interesting&amp;#8230; occasionally kicking down &amp;#8211; apparently very painful, that.</description>

      <description>The &amp;#8220;lil&amp;#8217; nug&amp;#8221; inside Anita is currently the size of a kidney bean.&amp;nbsp; The organs have all begun developing and the heart is beating strong, at 142 beats/min.&amp;nbsp; Bloodwork and whatnot seem fine.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve got very uninformative ultrasound images which I may get scanned and post sometime&amp;#8230;
We&amp;#8217;re still both pretty attached to the name &amp;#8220;Ruby&amp;#8221; for a girl.&amp;nbsp; Not sure about a boys name.</description>

      <description>After several years of marriage and putting off having kids till we were more financially stable&amp;#8230; we are now pregnant. Due in Jan. or Feb. 2008. We have no data, but &amp;#8220;think&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s going to be a girl&amp;#8230;
Apparently, a few days ago, anita woke up from an amazingly realistic dream where she was holding &amp;#8220;our baby girl&amp;#8221;. We didn&amp;#8217;t really think she was pregnant but after the dream, she had to take a pregnancy test and it turns out we are.</description>
