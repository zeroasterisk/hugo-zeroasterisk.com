      <title>Life Changlingly Good TED Radio Hour: “The Source of Creativity”</title>

      <description>http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/351538855/the-source-of-creativity
Basic summary: &amp;#8220;everyone is and can be creative: you just have to be fearless about failing, and practice a bunch.&amp;#8221;
Led to this understanding by my art-teacher mother, since early childhood I&amp;#8217;ve been saying something pretty similar.
Creativity is wonderful, amazing, useful, freeing, and fun&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s not rare. Being creative is a skill, available to everyone. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be &amp;#8220;Art&amp;#8221; (note the capital A) nor innovation. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be shared.</description>

      <description>Most of you have heard from the grapevine or facebook (this generation&amp;#8217;s grapevine) that our son, Oliver Jackson Blount, was born on 2010-02-02 @ 14:35 EST. He was 9 pounds 15 ounces and 23 inches (they measured twice to be sure).
We had a home birth with 2 midwives and an apprentice, a doula, Anita&amp;#8217;s mom (former NICU nurse) and sister Virginia (new nurse) in attendance&amp;#8230; of yeah, and me. The decision to have a home birth was one we took very seriously and subsequently are very happy with; it being unusual is often the topic of conversation&amp;#8230; but I can summarize with the following: We had a normal and healthy fetus inside a normal and healthy mom, everything looking like it would progress as &amp;#8220;low risk&amp;#8221; we choose to stay at home with the support of professionals vs.</description>

      <title>A Month of Site-Downtime</title>

      <description>So the website has been down from Oct 21st to Nov 23rd. The old server got hacked (or really, a sister-server) and due to security concerns, we didn&amp;#8217;t know what got owned and what was safe. We already had a different server hardware to put in place, just had to set it up. So we got that installed and up and running, but it took me a few more days to get around to implementing something on my site.</description>

      <description>Mom and Sam drove to Louisville for a few days this past weekend+ (Friday &amp;#8211; Tuesday).
We all had a wonderful visit and they played with poppy almost nonstop&amp;#8230; as expected. We took full advantage of the free babysitting and went out a few nights and on the whole, were less than adequate hosts, but they didn&amp;#8217;t seem to mind.
Mom&amp;#8217;s posted her photos here, and below is a slideshow</description>

      <description>Scott and Tami had a wonderful wedding in Columbus in late fall 2008. We went with Poppy and my mom Cathy. At the wedding they had a photobooth set up and some of the photos went into a scrapbook and some we took home&amp;#8230; here are the took home ones.</description>

      <description>We went to Houston this year, for Poppy&amp;#8217;s first Christmas and spent almost a week with my family.&amp;nbsp; Everyone loved and was amazed by Poppy, of course and she did splendidly.&amp;nbsp; She traveled quite well, sleeping for the first part of both flights and playing quietly for the second.&amp;nbsp; She also did a remarkably good job dealing with all the people she didn&amp;#8217;t really know and the back and forth craziness of going from house to house to house.</description>

      <title>we refinanced our mortgage today</title>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2008/12/17/we-refinanced-our-mortgage-today/</guid>
      <description>We have refinanced (or at least started the process) and locked in at 4.96 after paying a point (it was 5.6 without the point, lenders wanting up-front money and assurance in today&amp;#8217;s market). We are rolling in the point and closing costs into the new loan and we&amp;#8217;ll still be saving $140/month over our current loan (and if we hadn&amp;#8217;t rolled in the costs, it would only have saved us $21/month more).</description>

      <description>We were talking about this recently and we realized that in the past two years:     We have&amp;nbsp;lived in 5 different places (our apt in Columbus, Anita&amp;#8217;s mom&amp;#8217;s for a few months, Chili&amp;#8217;s house for almost a year, Houston with my family for a couple of months, and finally our new house)     I have&amp;nbsp;worked 6 positions in 3 companies, not counting consulting gigs on the side.</description>

      <description>An email from my Mom who recently visited us. It&amp;#8217;s a great recap and update on Poppy, so I&amp;#8217;m just pasting in here:
 I recommend becoming a grandmother &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the best! I have just returned from a week in Louisville with Alan and Anita&amp;#8230;and Poppy, which included two Halloween parties, a wedding in Columbus, a long walk in Iroquois park to check out the fall colors, two swimming lessons for Poppy (with Anita), and progress made on Poppy&amp;#8217;s room mural by my good friend, Joan Firster and me.</description>

      <description>Saturday night we got back home and were amazed to see lights on.&amp;nbsp; LG&amp;amp;E rigged up some scary looking connections across downed lines (we will not go walking on stilts), but they got our block light up&amp;#8230; faster than I expected.
We were without power for right at a week, and it certainly could have been much worse.&amp;nbsp; We had no damage and no monetary loss (except the food in the fridge/freezer).</description>

We&amp;#8217;ve been finishing up packing and moving into our new house!
As such &amp;#8211; things are of course &amp;#8211; crazy and i&amp;#8217;m beaten down (in fact, I
might have very very mild heat stroke) &amp;#8211; but we&amp;#8217;re both really happy to

      <description>We have made an offer on 183 Coral Ave. and it was accepted (finally).
You may have heard about the problems we had with the last house we were interested in, so were were trying not to get our hopes up too much &amp;#8211; but now we are signed and contracted&amp;#8230; good to go.
The house is big enough with a little expansion room in the basement, across the street from a great park and on an almost double lot.</description>

      <description>We had gotten VERY excited about a house we were going to buy.
We made an offer, they countered, we accepted&amp;#8230; all today (Sunday). We were waiting on the counter-offer-paperwork to sign and send back&amp;#8230; well, instead of getting that, we actually got notified that the offer was retracted. Someone else made a better offer and we weren&amp;#8217;t given an option to bid back.
Of course, this was after we&amp;#8217;d told everyone and after we&amp;#8217;d gotten really, really excited about this house.</description>

      <description>Poppy at Month four:
This month has been quite productive. She has been growing by leaps and bounds, like
normal. She&amp;#8217;s now reaching for everything and
putting it all in her mouth and dropping it on the floor. Nothing is safe within a foot and a half of her. She is sitting up well, if you help her
out. She&amp;#8217;s standing well, if you help her out. I think she is just</description>

      <description>we had a date last night (our first in 6+ months) and ate Ethiopian food and watched &amp;#8220;Iron Man&amp;#8220;. Both the food and the movie were fantastic!
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because we haven&amp;#8217;t really had a night to ourselves in a while; maybe it&amp;#8217;s because we haven&amp;#8217;t seen a movie in a few months&amp;#8230; but we both loved every second of our date and I personally will be re watching iron man a few times.</description>

      <description>Update &amp;#8211; we are in Houston for April and May. Staying w/ family and
Anita&amp;#8217;s doing her last rotation at a hospital here. They are kicking
her ass and not even saying sorry&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s the home stretch till
she&amp;#8217;s finally done with school forever! (YAY)
Poppy is big-tastic. She is holding her head up all the time,
laughing a little (when tickled or otherwise super-excited) and smiling
a lot. She&amp;#8217;s almost on a schedule &amp;#8211; which includes 15-30 min of crying</description>

times, but it was just less than what we had prepared for. An 8.5 hour
leg of the trip took 11 hours.
We got to stop in KC and see Karen, Aunt Sue, and Uncle Richard. We
stayed for breakfast and then drove to Gainsville and visited my uncle
Bob. That 7 hour drive took about 10. After staying the night with</description>

      <description>I arrived at the Louisville, KY airport at 5:30am, Feb 29 and tried to check in for my flight #1755 to Dallas, TX. As it turns out, the confirmation/look up number I received with my itinerary was invalid. They couldn&amp;#8217;t find it. And then, upon further investigation, the ticket had been refunded or somehow mis-scheduled. I had to get back in line (I&amp;#8217;d been holding up the line this whole time and by now, it was long).</description>

      <description>My buddy Jason Smithson recently posted something about mint.com and I decided to check it out.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a fantastic site, very easy to use, and provides a very simple overview of the categories of my spending.
So, I know I spend X% on food and Y% on rent&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;ve been nothing but impressed.
There&amp;#8217;s also a &amp;#8220;how to save money&amp;#8221; section which strikes me as advertising and I&amp;#8217;ve dutifully ignored it.</description>

      <description>My life has shifted. If my perspective on the world were comprised of tectonic plates &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s as if a new continent has formed, replete with earthquakes, tsunamis, and the readjustment of every other piece of the former world. That analogy is poor, because in my case, all these changes are great. Great is an understatement; magnificent is an understatement.
So &amp;#8211; here&amp;#8217;s the short story for those who haven&amp;#8217;t heard it yet.</description>

The only real complaint I have is that Penelope isn&amp;#8217;t here yet.</description>

      <description>Anita and I went to the Dr. and got the latests baby-weight&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s 31 pounds.&amp;nbsp; That takes the pregnancy weight from ~20% to ~25% of her previous body weight.&amp;nbsp;
A picture&amp;#8217;s worth 1000 words&amp;#8230; and I&amp;#8217;m wouldn&amp;#8217;t write that much anyway, but here are some pictures to prove my point:

      <description>Hello everyone.&amp;nbsp; We like to do things a bit latter&amp;#8230;
you know, catch the after Christmas sales and have more time to
prepare.&amp;nbsp; This year that philosophy also extends to Christmas cards and
in this case, emails.
The year of 2007
January of 2007 Alan&amp;#8217;s team got outsourced to Singapore and he found a new job working for friends doing web development.&amp;nbsp; Alan also picked up a contracting job which ended up being part-time which ended up being his new full time job this November.</description>

      <description>A good and busy Christmas this year.&amp;nbsp; We stayed in Louisville because Anita&amp;#8217;s too close to due-date to travel.&amp;nbsp; Had 7 different family engagements in two days and enjoyed every one&amp;#8230; though at the end of things we are certainly tired.&amp;nbsp; We had too much food and too much sugar, enough sleep and a great amount of fun.

      <description>Heading to the company meeting in Dallas, I was able to swing into Gainsville, TX for a couple of days to visit Bob And Doris (my Uncle and Aunt on my Dad&amp;#8217;s side).
Doris is pretty much confined to a bed or wheelchair, but amazingly she seems to be in good spirits and would be her same old self if only her body would cooperate.
Bob is ok aside from a month long lung infection of some sort and continual problems with his coumadin.</description>

      <description>This is about the best news ever.&amp;nbsp; (my stomach thinks so)
We just heard about this today, and went to Maido&amp;#8217;s (in Louisville, KY &amp;#8211; map)&amp;#8230;. it was absolutely fantastic!
For less than $9, you get to pick over some of the best Japanese food in Louisville.&amp;nbsp; As of now, it&amp;#8217;s only been open for lunch for about a week and there were few people there.&amp;nbsp; So go quick.
I suspect when word of this gets out, it will either stop or get ridiculously busy.</description>

      <description>Here are the ultrasounds from Anita&amp;#8217;s Dr. visits. Poor quality images all, as they are on some kind of heat-transfer paper they don&amp;#8217;t last, especially not in the heat. That said &amp;#8211; they weren&amp;#8217;t good quality images in the first place.
   
They are neat images though.amazing to see it grow from a bean to a vertebrate in a fairly short period of time. Fingers and toes&amp;#8230; brain and legs.</description>

      <description>After several years of marriage and putting off having kids till we were more financially stable&amp;#8230; we are now pregnant. Due in Jan. or Feb. 2008. We have no data, but &amp;#8220;think&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s going to be a girl&amp;#8230;
Apparently, a few days ago, anita woke up from an amazingly realistic dream where she was holding &amp;#8220;our baby girl&amp;#8221;. We didn&amp;#8217;t really think she was pregnant but after the dream, she had to take a pregnancy test and it turns out we are.</description>

      <description>Petition to save Internet Radio: http://capwiz.com/saveinternetr
 I&amp;#8217;ve been reading up on copyright laws in America and internationally and it seems blatantly obvious that the extra costs and constraints put on internet radio are one symptom of a larger problem&amp;#8230; that our copyright system is outmoded by the technologies of the past 20 years. That&amp;#8217;s a larger problem for another day {read &amp;#8220;Free Culture&amp;#8221; for more information}.For now&amp;#8230; lets look at Internet Radio.</description>

      <description>So, due to a degraded HDD in my RAID5 array, I decided to build a new array.
I bought 4 320G Seagate drives&amp;#8230; those drives have many benifits, not least of which, a 5 year warranty.
I already have a 3ware escalade RAID controller (7506-4LP), one of the best options for a hardware RAID controller.
Instead of building another RAID5, I chose to build 2, RAID1 arrays. I chose this because it&amp;#8217;s much easier to buy 2 hard drives (upgrading one mirrored pair) than to buy 4 hard drives (to upgrade a 4 disk array).</description>

      <description>As one might so commonly read on IT employee blogs, &amp;#8220;our team has been laid off&amp;#8221;.
That&amp;#8217;s right, the whole team is being outsourced to Singapore, effective Jan 31.
It will be a near-future disaster for the company, though it might encourage the abandonment of many applications and proceedures which I&amp;#8217;ve been complaining about for years. But though on paper it looks like money saved, I suspect it will end up as more costly to keep things working/improving or a less expensive disaster where nothing works.</description>

      <description>My past 3 weeks&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;ve worked ~210 hours&amp;#8230; that averages to 70 hours per week&amp;#8230; but really I worked almost 100 hours in one 7 day period.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One day, i worked from 6am &amp;#8211; 2am, and one day I worked from 9am &amp;#8211; 2am.&amp;nbsp; Always getting up and working the next day by 9am at the latest and working more than a full day&amp;#8230; every day.
Why would I do such horrendous work?</description>

      <description>CUDA Fall League 2006 started today&amp;#8230; it was a lot of fun!
Less serious than summer league, but a little more serious than a regular pickup game&amp;#8230; we played light on numbers as a lot of players were out of town for tournaments.
If you didn&amp;#8217;t make it, but want to come out&amp;#8230; you should!</description>

      <description>Anita, our step sister Maddie (14), and I went to Houston, from July 20 through August 1st.&amp;nbsp; We drove.
[map] First, we drove to and camped at the Hot Springs National Park, during the hottest part of a heat wave.&amp;nbsp; Our A/C could occasionally not keep up, it was so hot&amp;#8230; so when we ended up at the park, we went wading (which turned into swimming for some) in a creek that ran through the park.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t often randomly surf for people&amp;#8230; but this guy [Matthias Wandel] wrote some software I was using (for the first time, about 5-6 years ago) [jhead] and I randomly browsed over to his personal site and thought he was really (really) cool&amp;#8230; Neat projects and inventions, done both logically and creatively (a combination I admire and strive for, though which I tend to exhibit to a lessor degree).
he came up in conversation again today and so I found his site again and found this page (among others) which just makes me go all warm and fuzzy:</description>

      <description>Friday, Anita and I went to Bardstown, Ky to go &amp;#8220;Moonlight Kyaking&amp;#8221; with Theresa and some of her Rugby Teammates/friends [link].
Before we got there we swung by the Jim Beam plant (thinking it was where Myra did a bunch of cool carpentry work, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t) and then the Bernheim Forrest. Bernheim has always been a great place to get back to nature a bit, but it&amp;#8217;s gotten a lot nicer&amp;#8230; the visitor&amp;#8217;s center is amazing, and all the displays and trails we saw, were flawless.</description>

      <description>Text of an email I spammed to just about everyone I have an address for:
 ===INTRO==============
I&amp;#8217;m sorry to have sent what could be considered propaganda to you. I believe it&amp;#8217;s well put together and raises very important questions, furthermore validating those questions and invalidating many official responses with evidence. Because of this, and because it&amp;#8217;s so easy to send around (just a link to a video) I have decided to send it to just about everyone in my address book.</description>

What?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You want to know what I&amp;#8217;m talking about?&amp;nbsp;
Simply, it&amp;#8217;s a brilliant option for listen to music.&amp;nbsp; You go to that site, create an ID (only requires an email address) and you get a personalized (personalizable) streaming radio station determined from a seed artist or song.
How does it know what music to select?&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s made by the people who did the music gennome project, so they have littereally mapped and classified music (fairly well, it seems) and allow you to guide your station(s) accordingly&amp;#8230; bring in variety or isolate to a single vein; the choice is yours&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>so &amp;#8211; there&amp;#8217;s some buzz going on (yes, I&amp;#8217;m a few days behind) about AOL and Yahoo letting companies pay (them) to send spam&amp;#8230; but disallowing spam otherwise&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;
what?&amp;nbsp;
If you could dis-allow it, do so.&amp;nbsp; If your plan is put into effect, that means more spam in the inbox.&amp;nbsp; It makes no sense.&amp;nbsp; (links below)

 Achtung! You are 23% brainwashworthy, 18% antitolerant, and 28% blindly patriotic
Congratulations! You are not susceptible to brainwashing, your values and cares extend beyond the borders of your own country, and your Blind Patriotism does not reach unhealthy levels. If you had been German in the 30s, you would&amp;#8217;ve left the country. One bad scenario &amp;#8212; as I hypothetically project you back in time &amp;#8212; is that you just wouldn&amp;#8217;t have cared one way or the other about Nazism.</description>

      <description>Yes, once again, Alan is in posession of a mohawk&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; life is good &amp;#8211; life is good.&amp;nbsp;
A mohawk is a wonderful thing for several reasons.&amp;nbsp; Some of them are:
 I have hair on the top of my head still, might as well enjoy it. It improves my ultimate frisbee game (seriously). It reminds me and anyone else that I&amp;#8217;m not really all the way old, yet. It helps instantly filter people, like John&amp;#8217;s pants, for any who know.</description>

We got a Sealy : Reflexion : Venice Beach &amp;#8211; a big latext foam bed. We bought it at us-matress.com, but we only had to buy the mattres (no box spring) so it ended up being a less than what you see as the cost.</description>

Thanks to all who have sent cards, emails, IMs, phone calls, etc to wish me a happy one. I&amp;#8217;m rather surprised so many people have remembered. Also, special thanks to the &amp;#8220;check givers&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; all that money is going into savings to replenish the money that was withdrawn to pay for our new bed (soon to arrive).
I&amp;#8217;m surprised to see that so many people sent jokes (or at least comments) about how old I was getting.</description>

      <description>Before we went to Houston, Anita and I spent some time in Louisville.
We were able to see some friends and a good amount of family. We missed out on the big family events, as we were in Houston then&amp;#8230; but we still got to play some games and relax and eat and all the basic events of together-hood.
I worked in the Louisville office, but because most people weren&amp;#8217;t there, I was able to get more work done than I usually do when I go into the office&amp;#8230; but still less than I can get done at home&amp;#8230; weird, huh?</description>

      <description>I spent many full and well populated days in Houston. Anita and I spent nights at various family houses, ate some of the best food we had eaten all year, and most importantly &amp;#8211; got to spend good time with our family together.
Here are some of the highlights:
 Great quality time with family (can&amp;#8217;t mention it enough &amp;#8211; strange that just spending time is so important, so simple, and so rare) Got to meet Scott&amp;#8217;s girlfriend, Ilah (ee-lah) Good but sad visits with my grandmother [Penny]1 Games played : rummykub, canasta, hearts, pictionary, balderdash, ping pong (I won at ping-pong and sometime I won at canasta, but lost everything else) Food, food, and food (including some mango salsa I made, which everyone appeared to appreciate) Ikea blitz &amp;#8211; a 1 hour run through ikea resulting in a total bill of less than $150 for Anita and myself (incredible for us consumer sheep)  One of the important parts which gets a bit of a review is my visit with my grandmother &amp;#8220;Penny&amp;#8221;, who has Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>So, when flying to Houston, early on Monday the 19th of December I ran into a slight problem.
I went through security without issue, and my laptop bag had to go through&amp;#8230; and I overheard security people being called over, waited, and heard a couple of other security people being called over. About this time I get nervous and soon overhear something I would rather not have heard.
Apparently, I had forgotten that I had put some gifts in my laptop bag, that I got for people at work in Japan&amp;#8230; They were very unimpressive, unassuming, decoration-only, ummm, throwing stars.</description>

We are also bringing Ginni&amp;#8217;s queen sized mattress (strapped to the roof of the CRV with ratchet-straps and bungies). That will make for a slightly slower drive, but shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too bad (I hope). In addition, it will be Anita, Alan, John, and Nova in the car with a few weeks worth of stuff for all.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been encouraging her to do this&amp;#8230; though her ~10 hours of work a week doesn&amp;#8217;t sound like much, since she does ~60 hours a week of school work &amp;#8211; a few extra hours to relax would be welcome.

      <description>After reading the article: CIA prisons leak &amp;#8216;to be probed&amp;#8217;, I was overcome one specific emotion: unease (fear)&amp;#8230; The fact that there are secret prisons and nobody knows about them scares the hell out of me.
Basically, if I was taken to prison for thinking our current government sucks (or for being too cynical or too naive), I would want people to know about it&amp;#8230; and hopefully make a fuss&amp;#8230; you know&amp;#8230; maybe get to talk to a lawyer and not be tortured.</description>

 PHP catching on at enterprises, vying with Java Not only is it cool my boss sent it to me, but the content of the article is great news for anyone who is a fan of PHP&amp;#8230; (and anyone who doesn&amp;#8217;t know if they are or not, I very much am&amp;#8230; so if you can&amp;#8217;t form your own opinion on the topic, you may borrow mine) As more and more businesses realize the power, flexibility, and simplicity of PHP &amp;#8211; as it comes into the mainstream more and more &amp;#8211; I get more chances to work with it, teach friends about it, get paid to build stuff with it&amp;#8230; etc.</description>

      <description>Pre-Halloween Party : Hell House II
Well, as with pretty much all DJ Foursquare (and hushabye house) parties, this was a great event. Chill people, great crowd, good venue (effective at least), great music, etc&amp;#8230; It also benifited from a great collection of costumes and a very moderate and (sorry for this review) disney-land-like bondage show&amp;#8230; Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t think the crew was disney-land&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure they had to weak-i-fy their setup/show for the audience invovled.</description>

      <description>I played ultimate frisbee today, one of the last evening games of the year.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s been getting dark earlier every week and now we have to stop playing around 7:15&amp;hellip; when you start at 6:00 of after, that&amp;rsquo;s really frustrating.
What might have been frustrating was that it was cold and rainy today, starting to be really ugly right about the time we started playing&amp;hellip; but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t frustrating at all.</description>

The most appealing of these recent travels, for me, is the Grounds for Sculpture&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Hamilton, New Jersey (</description>

      <description>I just took a Typology Test and ended up as ENFJ which broke down as the following:
 [17%] Extroverted [25%] Intuitive [12%] Feeling [67%] Judging  You can read more about the ENFJ type by looking at the following descriptions&amp;hellip; one by D.Keirsey&amp;nbsp;and one by J. Butt.
Update &amp;#8211; Oct. 11
I found out that according to the Typology tests, the perfect match for ENFJ is ISFJ, and Anita is who got me to take the test&amp;#8230; So, I had to find out what her type was&amp;#8230; and of coruse, she&amp;#8217;s ISFJ.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a comprehensive theme, currently called za1 (very exciting name, eh?).&amp;nbsp; I will be mapping the components of my site into that theme (instead of hacking the themes of the components of my site to look kindof like each other).
The themes are driven primarily by CSS, and done in such a way as to allow simple variations in how things should look&amp;hellip; there will be an &amp;ldquo;options&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;selector on the top-right and it will allow you to easily choose theme options and it saves your options as a cookie (if you allow the cookie) or session variables if your don&amp;rsquo;t allow the cookies.</description>

      <description>Saturday Anita had to work, but Phil, Sarah, Jess, and Phil&amp;rsquo;s friend Tom came over and played Mao&amp;nbsp;1.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s a great game &amp;ndash; and surprisingly effective at bringing about a represive dictatorial feel in the players (who thought that could be so much fun?).&amp;nbsp;
We played a variant where after winning 3 rounds you could make up your own rule&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; my personal favorite was (my rule): you have to use rapper hands whenever you call penalty on someone.</description>

      <description>So &amp;#8211; Capture the Flag was a lot of fun. We played at the Park of Roses on August 21 2005 (after sundown). We had 9 people show and had a great time, though we were out classed severely by some &amp;#8220;in shape&amp;#8221; players. I&amp;#8217;m hoping to end up with more people in a bigger area for the next game on September 9th (friday) at an unknown location.
Google is incredible.</description>

      <description>We have kittens.

That&amp;#8217;s right, it&amp;#8217;s cute-fest-2005 in our apartment right now. We got a pair of 8 6 week old kittens on Sunday from Anita&amp;#8217;s co-worker who got them dumped on her by her mom. They are a brother (black) and sister (white &amp;amp; orange) and have very quickly bonded with Anita and I&amp;#8230; they are ok with Nova, but she&amp;#8217;s not yet ok with them. Nova actually submitted to them, belly up and looking away; our guard dog proving her grit once again.</description>

It was something I kept putting off, but I&amp;#8217;m real glad I did it &amp;#8211; the posts are kinda long, but it&amp;#8217;s as much for my memory of the trip as anyone else&amp;#8217;s (sorry).
 I&amp;#8217;m impressed that within 45 minutes of uploading the lastest batch of photos, some of them have been looked at 4 times already&amp;#8230; I know I&amp;#8217;m just getting lucky, but it still nice to know someone is looking.</description>

      <description>Anita and I were planning on staying up all Monday night and going to the Tokyo Fish Market at 5 am on Tuesday, but around 3am we crashed. Anita got up at 4:30 and fully intended to get me up, but she saw that a sub-tropical-storm was headed at Tokyo and that it was already raining pretty hard… There’s something about being dog tired and lost in a city that is much worse sounding if you add in the attribute &amp;#8211; rain soaked.</description>

      <description>After the late night before, we all slept in… Anita and I slept in so much we missed our hotel’s breakfast. We found a snack and took the subway to the Tokyo Aquarium. It was totally disappointing. The animals had very small enclosures, particularly bothersome were the mammals. There were many dead or dirty exhibits and not too much to read in English… We left after (something like) an hour and a half and roamed the “Sunshine 60” shopping complex (basically a big mall like the galleria in Houston without the ice skating rink).</description>

      <description>Another morning of repacking, a walk to the station, and a train ride to Tokyo (~3 hours)… most people napped (I read).
 We got out at Tokyo and took a subway to the hotel, dropped off our packs, and walked around to find food. Ironically, our hotel was right next to Akihabara, the Electronic Market in Tokyo, and it was Sunday, a day so busy the street is shut down to vehicles and the area is swarmed with geeks of all varieties and the people that feed on/off them.</description>

      <description>On our second full day in Kyoto we ate the last of the Fruit and some of the granola bars for breakfast; then we hopped on the #100 bus for the east side of Kyoto to see Ginkakuji-michi (the Silver Temple). The Silver Temple was much better than the Golden Temple because it was less overrun with tourists and also because the surrounding gardens were amazing. The cultivation of moss is, itself, remarkable, but to see the whole garden come together is quite impressive.</description>

      <description>We got an early start, showered, dressed, and set out for the train station to buy bus passes before 8:00 am. 2,000 Yen for a 2 day all bus all subway pass is a good deal… also because it means you don’t have to pay attention to which company bus or subway you want to use, because in the city of Kyoto there are at least 3-4 different companies for public transit and most other passes don’t cover them all.</description>

      <description>We finished packing for a couple of hours and then took way too much stuff down to the Koori-Machi train station. We caught the 15 minute train to Fukushima and stuffed our packs into lockers at the train station there. (Except my pack, which wouldn’t fit in any of the lockers)
We then went to the 100 Yen store – the Japanese equivalent of the $1.00 store, but much, much cooler.</description>

      <description>Wednesday, we went to the elementary school April visits a few times a week. We did a brief tour of the classes and had an audience with the principal and vice-principal. The school seemed wonderful, but we didn’t have as much time to spend there as we did in Jo-Chu. We had to rush through the school, stop for a quick Ramen lunch, and be back at April’s apartment in time for Karen to receive a several wonderful gifts from some of April’s students who were in Elizabethtown last year.</description>

      <description>Tuesday 19 July 2005, we dressed in our nice clothes, carried our own house slippers so we didn’t have to use visitor slippers, and walked to Jo-Ho Chugakko Junior High School, known as Jo-Chu. Arriving at school a few minutes early (which was really on time) we met with the principal (Coach O’Sensei). Immediately we were amazed with how generous he was&amp;#8230; treating us like honored guests would be putting it mildly.</description>

      <description>This morning we ate fruit, cereal, and granola before setting out for Mount Azuma. We took the Aizu Bandi Skyline (highway) for some beautiful but quite frightening driving in the mountains. A couple hours of hair-pin turns and sulfur smelling air later, we ended up at Mount Azuma. It’s a large (dormant?) volcano crater in the midst of a gorgeous mountain range. We walked around the crater, against some very serious winds.</description>

It was a friend of a friend&amp;#8217;s dad&amp;#8217;s restaurant and we ended up being there 20 minutes before they opened, but they let us in and sat us by the window looking out onto their wonderful and very small garden. We had pork medallions and miso and cabbage salads and rice &amp;#8211; I had a curry dish.</description>

      <description>24 hours, is a long time to travel.
We flew to Chicago from Louisville, but got delayed on the runway in Louisville; so we had to run in Chicago to make it to our connecting flight to Tokyo&amp;#8230; we made it though, and started our ~11.5 hour flight.
The plane ride was fine, in that really long and tiring kinda way. We were good and stayed awake (mostly) in order to sync our sleep cycle with Japan which is almost exactly the opposite of our timezone.</description>
