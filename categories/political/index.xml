      <description>Wall Street&amp;#8217;s Socialist Jet-Setters By MAUREEN DOWD &amp;#8211; Published: January 27, 2009
 How are these ruthless, careless ghouls who murdered the economy still walking around (not to mention that sociopathic sadist Bernie Madoff?) — and not as perps?
Bring on the shackles. Let the show trials begin.
 Very frustrating indeed, but I don&amp;#8217;t know of any means of invoking a change. We can complain on the net and raise virtual pitchforks in anger&amp;#8230; but there&amp;#8217;s nothing which will come of it.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s my response to the following &amp;#8220;letter&amp;#8221; which I received as a forward today:
Letter subject: &amp;#8220;Memo to All My Valued Employees&amp;#8221;
Basic gist of the letter:
 Most of my time is now occupied with government mandates and regulations and all the accounting that goes with them. On October 15th, I wrote a check to the US Treasury for $288,000 for quarterly taxes. You know what my “stimulus” check was?</description>

      <description>Helping to Write History
By Eli Saslow
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 18, 2008; Page A01
 During the campaign, the buzz-cut 27-year-old at the corner table helped write and edit some of the most memorable speeches of any recent presidential candidate. When Obama moves to the White House next month, Favreau will join his staff as the youngest person ever to be selected as chief speechwriter. He helps shape almost every word Obama says, yet the two men have formed a concert so harmonized that Favreau&amp;#8217;s own voice disappears.</description>

      <description>An excellent article on Walmart being evil or not &amp;#8211; a fairly objective seeming overview of the major points of discussion for the different camps on Walmart.
 That&amp;#8217;s a good thing, right? If a company achieves its lower prices by finding better and smarter ways of doing things, then yes, everybody wins. But if it cuts costs by cutting pay and benefits&amp;#8211;or by sending production to China&amp;#8211;then not everybody wins.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m one of the first to speak out against the current (soon-to-change-thank-god) US government, but this video really does make me sad. I have little to say positive toward G.W.Bush and have certainly complained about him (often) when really complaining about the actions of many many people&amp;#8230; but I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d go so far as to refuse to shake his hand. I mean, he&amp;#8217;s still a person.
On the otherhand, I myself have toyed with the idea of considering him a mass murderer&amp;#8230; so from that perspective, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to shake his hand or be in the same room with him.</description>

      <description>One sunny day in 2009 an old man approached the White House
from across Pennsylvania Avenue, where he&amp;#8217;d been sitting on a
park bench. He spoke to the U.S. Marine standing guard and
said, &amp;#8216;I would like to go in and meet with President Bush.&amp;#8217;
The Marine looked at the man and said, &amp;#8216;Sir, Mr. Bush is no longer
president and no longer resides here.&amp;#8217;
The old man said, &amp;#8216;Okay, thank you&amp;#8217; and walked away.</description>

      <description>I feel like I should have something profound to say.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;ve been a supporter since I picked up one of his books and have grown more so as I&amp;#8217;ve found out more and more about Obama and his family and views and campaign.
We watched the results at our friend&amp;#8217;s house and were ready to cry together, but thankfully we didn&amp;#8217;t have to.&amp;nbsp; After the last two presidential elections, I was pessimistic and ready to be disappointed &amp;#8211; when Obama won I really had to do a couple of reality checks.</description>

      <description>NY Times article:
Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending : September 30, 1999
 In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.
The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets &amp;#8212; including the New York metropolitan region &amp;#8212; will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans.</description>

      <description>Something has come to me, in the light of the current financial crisis in this country&amp;#8230;
Most people in this country are now aware that we are on the brink of a depression as serious as the one in the 1930s.&amp;nbsp; People are up in arms, talking to their congressional representatives and it is all over the media.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;#8217;s action (or at least attempted and perhaps misguided action) in our government to fix some of the problems, and we are all sure the sky is falling and things need to be done.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m Voting Republican is a satirical look at the likely outcome of another four years of Republican government. The not-so-subtle message behind the film is the importance of a united bloc of citizens willing to take the time and effort to vote Democrat in order to improve America&amp;#8217;s domestic and foreign policy.

      <description>Not that it matters to most of you, but a friend of mine reminded me that I should indicate who I am voting for&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; If for nothing else I like the following line:
 I offer trustworthy, competent and genuine leadership. I am not a Politician.
 Of course, anyone can say that &amp;#8211; but my general feeling is that he would be a good Senator.

      <description>Sadly for Bush and Cheney, Greenspan decided to put prudence aside in his new book, The Age of Turbulence, and answer the most neuralgic issue of our times – why the United States invaded Iraq.
Greenspan writes:
&amp;#8220;I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil.&amp;#8221;
Everyone knows? Would that it were so. But it’s hardly everyone. Sometimes I think it’s hardly anyone.</description>

 &amp;#8220;Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward … and freedom will be defended.&amp;#8221; In other words, George W. Bush thought that the reason the United States was attacked was that the attackers hated our freedom. How did he reach this conclusion?</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re tired of propaganda; tired of conspiracy theorists telling you that your media is mostly brainwashing you into the party line of big brother&amp;#8230; &amp;nbsp;
Wake up.
There is a lot of conspiracy theory which must be wrong. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#8217;s nuts&amp;#8230; so you choose not to belive it. &amp;nbsp;You don&amp;#8217;t accept things at face value. &amp;nbsp;You look for evidence to refute crazy stories.
Good.

 Hearken to the astonishing rhetoric Bush used at the American Legion Convention in Las Vegas against Tehran:
&amp;#8220;Iran &amp;#8230; is the world&amp;#8217;s leading state sponsor of terrorism. &amp;#8230; Iran funds terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which murder the innocent and target Israel. &amp;#8230; Iran is sending arms to the Taliban.</description>

He never told the people in Louis’ phone book that he had died, nor invited them to a service if there was one. No one even knows where he is buried.</description>

      <description>Petition to save Internet Radio: http://capwiz.com/saveinternetr
 I&amp;#8217;ve been reading up on copyright laws in America and internationally and it seems blatantly obvious that the extra costs and constraints put on internet radio are one symptom of a larger problem&amp;#8230; that our copyright system is outmoded by the technologies of the past 20 years. That&amp;#8217;s a larger problem for another day {read &amp;#8220;Free Culture&amp;#8221; for more information}.For now&amp;#8230; lets look at Internet Radio.</description>

      <description>While suturing a cut on the hand of a 75-year-old Texas rancher, whose hand was caught in a gate while working cattle, the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man. Eventually, the topic got around to former Texas Governor George W. Bush and his elevation to the White House.
The old Texan said, &amp;#8220;Well, ya know, Bush is a &amp;#8216;post turtle&amp;#8217;.&amp;#8221; Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a &amp;#8216;post turtle&amp;#8217; was.</description>

      <description>CNN.com &amp;#8211; GOP split as Senate panel bucks Bush on terror tribunals &amp;#8211; Sep 15, 2006:
 The bill was backed by Republican Sens. John Warner of Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
It differs from the administration&amp;#8217;s proposal in two major ways: It would permit terror suspects to view classified evidence against them and does not include a proposal that critics say reinterprets a Geneva Conventions rule that prohibits cruel and inhuman treatment of detainees.</description>

That said, I&amp;#8217;m seriously worried about the &amp;#8220;bigger stick&amp;#8221; theory as it escelates into&amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; the upper ranges of weaponry we&amp;#8217;ve had for a few decades. Though we&amp;#8217;ve been sitting on (or making more) weapons and not really attacking with them (just testing them)&amp;#8230; they exist to be used and can be within minutes from right now.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m sorry to have sent what could be considered propaganda to you. I believe it&amp;#8217;s well put together and raises very important questions, furthermore validating those questions and invalidating many official responses with evidence. Because of this, and because it&amp;#8217;s so easy to send around (just a link to a video) I have decided to send it to just about everyone in my address book.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s a great overview of / perspective on the Christian &amp;#8220;pro-end-of-the-world&amp;#8221; movement which has begun (in this country) to not only become fairly popular, but to be largely represented in the government and the financial elite.&amp;nbsp;
This is, no doubt frightening&amp;#8230; but again, it brings me back to one of my major complaints about most organized religion&amp;#8230; arrogance.</description>

      <description>I was recently sent a link to the article Explosive Testimony: Revelations about the Twin Towers in the 9&amp;frasl;11 Oral Histories, on the site 911truth.org. I think the article, though kind of long, deserves a read. I wasn&amp;#8217;t there but i agree that something happened&amp;#8230;. it is almost unbelievably incredible that both towers collapsed in such a seemingly controlled manner. If towers / buildings collapsed like that by design, building demolition companies wouldn&amp;#8217;t have a job&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>petition: The President Broke the Law
 President Bush admitted to personally authorizing thousands of allegedly illegal wiretaps, and he doesn&amp;#8217;t plan to stop. Circumventing the Constitution is serious business.
This is a big moment. People from across the political spectrum are standing together to protect the rule of law and the principles that are core to our identity as Americans.
Can you sign this petition to show Congress that Americans want a thorough investigation of the president&amp;#8217;s secret wiretapping program?</description>

 This is even sometimes discussed. You can find it in the strategic analysis literature. Take, say, the invasion of Iraq again. We&amp;#8217;re told that they didn&amp;#8217;t find weapons of mass destruction. Well, that&amp;#8217;s not exactly correct. They did find weapons of mass destruction, namely, the ones that had been sent to Saddam by the United States, Britain, and others through the 1980s.</description>

Too bad it&amp;#8217;s not something that I am hearing much about &amp;#8211; you all? No? You&amp;#8217;d think the investigation for presidential impeachment might be discussed on the evening news, eh?

      <description>Over 750,000 people have signed on to a letter urging the Senate to reject Samuel Alito&amp;#8217;s nomination to the Supreme Court. If you sign on, we&amp;#8217;re that much closer to making it a full one million: Sign the letter, (I did).
You can also use MoveOn.org to send a letter to your senator about Alito.
Personally, I think the lifetime apointments of Supreme Court Justices is dangerous in it&amp;#8217;s own right, but I can understand it to some extent&amp;#8230; I just think it&amp;#8217;s dangerous that the court can sway &amp;#8211; and then be stuck in it&amp;#8217;s sway for so long.</description>

Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it seem strange to be killing people for killing people?&amp;nbsp; I am aware that there are people that are dangerous enough to never let back into the population, but it seems hypocritical to kill them&amp;hellip; Aside from the people who are significant dangers to our society, prisons should generally be cleared out a lot.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Basically, if I was taken to prison for thinking our current government sucks (or for being too cynical or too naive), I would want people to know about it&amp;#8230; and hopefully make a fuss&amp;#8230; you know&amp;#8230; maybe get to talk to a lawyer and not be tortured.</description>

I was doing the Google &amp;ldquo;feeling lucky&amp;rdquo; thing, where you enter a word like &amp;ldquo;failure&amp;rdquo; and it gives your it&amp;rsquo;s best result&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; Well, for the word &amp;ldquo;failure&amp;rdquo; it isn&amp;rsquo;t random, it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; funny, appropriate, sad&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; Biography of President George W. Bush.
Anyway, so I tried again, I&amp;nbsp;entered &amp;ldquo;incompetent&amp;rdquo; and hit &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m feeling lucky&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; and I got&amp;nbsp;The President as Incompetent Liar.&amp;nbsp; I read this article, BTW, and it is very well done, I think.</description>

      <description>The World Can&amp;rsquo;t Wait&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; a site promoting active options for ridding ourselves of the current blight named G. W. Bush.&amp;nbsp;
   Yes, I believe blight is an appropriate term&amp;hellip; I mean seriously, how will our history books record this era in our country?&amp;nbsp; The American people were duped, and when they realized it, they were ok with it&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; disappoing sounding eh?     Good reading:   Oct.</description>

      <description>Challenged by Creationists, Museums Answer Back
(sorry, the link requires login)
Apparently, after a few rather agressive (not phiscally) confrontations with creationists, in science museums &amp;#8211; docents and volunteers are flocking to training on how to best respond to such challenges.
&amp;#8220;The goal is to understand the controversies, so that people are better able to handle them as they come up,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;Museums, as a field, have recognized we need to take a more proactive role in evolution education.</description>

      <description>Clinton launches withering attack on Bush on Iraq, Katrina, budget
Breaking with tradition under which US presidents mute criticisms of their successors, Clinton said the Bush administration had decided to invade Iraq &amp;#8220;virtually alone and before UN inspections were completed, with no real urgency, no evidence that there were weapons of mass destruction.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8230;
&amp;#8220;What Americans need to understand is that &amp;#8230; every single day of the year, our government goes into the market and borrows money from other countries to finance Iraq, Afghanistan, Katrina, and our tax cuts,&amp;#8221; he said.</description>

      <description>September 9th, it was ruled that Jose Padilla was still not to be given fair trial, in fact not to be charged with a crime nor to be given legal council.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s the first time this has ever happened in the US court system (to my knowledge)&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; Even actual &amp;ldquo;enemy combatants&amp;rdquo; in our previous wars, captured on the battlefield all got lawyers and full legal procedings.&amp;nbsp; Our courts were used, to verify and justify and validate.</description>
