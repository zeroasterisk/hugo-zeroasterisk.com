      <title>CakePHP beforeSave() gotcha: need to set $this-&gt;__exists to true if setting a primary key</title>

      <description>I added an update to CakePHP Book: beforeSave()
 Also, if you add a primary key which would turn an &amp;#8220;insert&amp;#8221; into an &amp;#8220;update&amp;#8221; within beforeSave() you&amp;#8217;ll need to set $this-&amp;gt;__exists = true;&amp;#8230; the call to $this-&amp;gt;exists(); happens in model.php before the callback to beforeSave().
function beforeSave() { if (!isset($this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isset($this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;unique_field&#39;])) { $found = $this-&amp;gt;find(&#34;first&#34;,array( &#34;recursive&#34; =&amp;gt; -1, &#34;fields&#34; =&amp;gt; array(&#34;id&#34;), &#34;conditions&#34; =&amp;gt; array(&#34;unique_field&#34; =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;unique_field&#39;]))); if (!empty($found) &amp;&amp; isset($found[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;])) { $this-&amp;gt;id = $this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;] = $found[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;]; $this-&amp;gt;__exists = true; } } return parent::beforeSave(); }  That&amp;#8217;s been confusing me a bit recently &amp;#8211; setting the ID of a row within beforesave() should change the save to an update, but it was trying to insert with a specified ID and thus, failing&amp;#8230; glad to have a simple solution that makes sense&amp;#8230; hope that helps someone else&amp;#8230;</description>

      <title>MySQL Master/Slave Replication Monitoring PHP Script</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2010/01/13/mysql-masterslave-replication-monitoring-php-script/</link>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a bit proud of myself on this one&amp;#8230; I setup a simple, but clean and configurable, MySQL Master/Slave Replication Monitoring PHP Script:
http://code.google.com/p/php-mysql-master-slave-replication-monitor/ (docs)
It&amp;#8217;s Open Source and free, I welcome comments, suggestions, and questions.
I think this will be quite useful for anyone who is setting up a pair of MySQL servers as master/slave and want to be sure their replication works as it should.

      <title>SVN Merge, making sure a branch is updated from trunk, then merging back to trunk</title>

      <description>So I&amp;#8217;ve just fought a battle w/ SVN merge and thought I&amp;#8217;d post the solution in case others might find it&amp;#8230;
Scenario
Our stable code is in trunk svn://svn.domain.tld/repository/trunk
I&amp;#8217;ve got a branch of trunk svn://svn.domain.tld/repository/branches/dev
Changes have been made to my branch and changes have been made to trunk, since I branched.
I&amp;#8217;m ready to merge my branch back into trunk.
Approach / Overview
Basically, to be safe, I need to first update my branch with the changes from trunk and resolve any conflicts.</description>

      <description>A very funny post for the programming nerds out there:
If programming languages were religions&amp;#8230;
By amz &amp;#8211; Monday, December 15, 2008 at 14:52
 PHP would be Cafeteria Christianity &amp;#8211; Fights with Java for the web market. It draws a few concepts from C and Java, but only those that it really likes. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s not as coherent as other languages, but at least it leaves you with much more freedom and ostensibly keeps the core idea of the whole thing.</description>

      <description>I just created a handy little script to create todos in basecamp for unresovled tickets in mantis.
You can see the open sourced code/project: http://code.google.com/p/mantis2basecamp-todo/.
This is something we found useful, if you use both tools, you might find it useful as well.
