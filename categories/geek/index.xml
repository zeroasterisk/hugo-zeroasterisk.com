      <description>Best part of CodepaLOUsa so far&amp;#8230; sitting next to Douglas Crockford at dinner tonight. Occasionally I&amp;#8217;m the lucky one. (Hope I didn&amp;#8217;t bore him too much)
Anyway &amp;#8211; having a fun time at CodepaLOUsa and hope all other attendees are too.

      <title>Meteor 0.9.2-rc1 is fun to play with, Cordova support functional</title>

      <description>Last night I started playing with `meteor &amp;#8211;release 0.9.2-rc1` which you can read about and play with too; check it out here:
https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Cordova-Z5n6zkVB1xq
It&amp;#8217;s wonderful!
The local development and hot-code-push is a great improvement over any other solution I&amp;#8217;ve been using. Builds were painless (mostly).
Most of my stumbling points were due to 9x, not the new Cordova stuff.
A few interesting details&amp;#8230;
Cordova gets built here:

      <title>Testing tools for Old OS &amp; Browser Combos</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2014/05/30/testing-old-os-browser/</link>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2014/05/30/testing-old-os-browser/</guid>
      <description>Lots of us have to trace down odd bugs and test things on different browsers and OS combinations&amp;#8230; Of course, the worst of which is &amp;#8220;various versions of IE&amp;#8221; on &amp;#8220;various versions of Windows&amp;#8221;. It seems crazy, but the same version of IE can behave differently on a different version of Windows.
The two best solutions I&amp;#8217;ve used are:
http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools [free, vm locally]
and
http://www.browserstack.com/ [costs, web based]
I just got assigned a crappy bug ticket on IE8 + WinXP and had to dust this off again&amp;#8230; thought I&amp;#8217;d send out a post, see if it helps others and triggers a discussion which might help me out too.</description>

      <description>http://readme.lk/noticed-tech-crowd-interview-arunoda-susiripala/
This advice might be aimed at people who already consider themselves developers, but there&amp;#8217;s a nugget in there that&amp;#8217;s perfect for anyone who is interested in getting started&amp;#8230;
Pick some open-source project, probably a smaller one, that does something you&amp;#8217;re interested in. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and used. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and it didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you looked at and didn&amp;#8217;t understand.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: see meteor-core-cordova-support-alpha-release-is-out (2014-08-25) for new information
&amp;nbsp;
About Meteor and PhoneGap / Cordova Meteor is a rapid server/client development framework, written in JS &amp;#8211; makes very interactive apps easy to build. http://meteor.com
PhoneGap / Cordova is a project to allow developers to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build mobile apps for all major devices. http://phonegap.com
Basics of Integrating Meteor + PhoneGap / Cordova The basic idea here is to use PhoneGap / Cordova to create a mobile App on several different platforms at once and it gives device hardware access; then “load” your Meteor application, which handles all of the rest of whatever you want your app to do.</description>

      <description>Everyone and their mom have been using Git and GitHub for a while, but I&amp;#8217;m just breaking down and using it&amp;#8230; I have been slow to adopt because SVN worked for me fine (until I had to merge branches) and I don&amp;#8217;t like to pay for storage space. But I continue to be impressed by it&amp;#8217;s functionality and ease of use, so I&amp;#8217;m going to move our work repositories over (needing a Large account probably) but I think it will be worth it.</description>

      <description>Alan&amp;#8217;s Google Profile, now updated with Buzz activity, searchable, and pulling content from various feeds, including flickr, facebook, twitter, etc&amp;#8230;
If you don&amp;#8217;t see this as &amp;#8220;competition&amp;#8221; for Facebook (et. al.) then you&amp;#8217;re not seeing the same thing I am.
I personally love it, esp. the publicly searchable aspects and the integration into the gmail interface but I might stop using it if other people don&amp;#8217;t or if it can&amp;#8217;t work two-way with facebook&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/01/modern-browsers-for-modern-applications.html
 Many other companies have already stopped supporting older browsers like Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers. We’re also going to begin phasing out our support, starting with Google Docs and Google Sites. As a result you may find that from March 1 key functionality within these products &amp;#8212; as well as new Docs and Sites features &amp;#8212; won’t work properly in older browsers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a bit proud of myself on this one&amp;#8230; I setup a simple, but clean and configurable, MySQL Master/Slave Replication Monitoring PHP Script:
http://code.google.com/p/php-mysql-master-slave-replication-monitor/ (docs)
It&amp;#8217;s Open Source and free, I welcome comments, suggestions, and questions.
I think this will be quite useful for anyone who is setting up a pair of MySQL servers as master/slave and want to be sure their replication works as it should.

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2009/11/23/autosearch-craigslist-with-google-alerts/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes, I want something only if it&amp;#8217;s on the cheap, second hand, and easy&amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s usually Craigslist.
Often what I want isn&amp;#8217;t available when I think of it&amp;#8230; but it might show up sometime&amp;#8230; I don&amp;#8217;t want to have to look at craigslist every day (because I wont).
Google Alerts to the rescue.
If I&amp;#8217;m in Louisville KY and I&amp;#8217;m looking for an iPod (for example) I just setup an alert for: &amp;#8220;site:louisville.</description>

      <description>So the website has been down from Oct 21st to Nov 23rd. The old server got hacked (or really, a sister-server) and due to security concerns, we didn&amp;#8217;t know what got owned and what was safe. We already had a different server hardware to put in place, just had to set it up. So we got that installed and up and running, but it took me a few more days to get around to implementing something on my site.</description>

      <title>SVN Merge, making sure a branch is updated from trunk, then merging back to trunk</title>

      <description>So I&amp;#8217;ve just fought a battle w/ SVN merge and thought I&amp;#8217;d post the solution in case others might find it&amp;#8230;
Scenario
Our stable code is in trunk svn://svn.domain.tld/repository/trunk
I&amp;#8217;ve got a branch of trunk svn://svn.domain.tld/repository/branches/dev
Changes have been made to my branch and changes have been made to trunk, since I branched.
I&amp;#8217;m ready to merge my branch back into trunk.
Approach / Overview
Basically, to be safe, I need to first update my branch with the changes from trunk and resolve any conflicts.</description>

 PHP would be Cafeteria Christianity &amp;#8211; Fights with Java for the web market. It draws a few concepts from C and Java, but only those that it really likes. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s not as coherent as other languages, but at least it leaves you with much more freedom and ostensibly keeps the core idea of the whole thing.</description>

      <description>A recent report from Don Jackson at SecureWorks (dated March 20 2007) examines a new Trojan and provides some alarming insights on Internet Identity Theft. It is worth reviewing this case carefully to understand how sophisticated modern identity theft schemes have become, and how difficult it can be to investigate and prevent them.What makes this Trojan interesting is that it:
 is installed automatically simply by visiting an infected web site is invisible to the user is often missed by anti-virus software is able to steal identity information even if it is encrypted using https efficiently collects large amounts of information and sends it to a “mother ship” provides an interface for fraudsters to easily purchase the stolen data is been used to collect thousands of login credentials at major banks and government agencies has not been shut down is only one of many such programs that are now offered as kits  source: http://www.</description>

      <description>Why You Should Turn Gmail’s SSL Feature On Now
 Let’s talk security and why you should take advantage of Gmail’s recent SSL feature, and why you might want to be careful using other non-SSL webmail services.
But first, make sure your connection is secured using SSL.
How do you know a connection is secured by SSL? The handy &amp;#8220;s&amp;#8221; after &amp;#8220;http&amp;#8221; will tell you. For example, https://mail.google.com is encrypted while http://mail.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been putting off upgrading to FF3 because I was afraid of plugins which wouldn&amp;#8217;t work and at this point, I live by many of my FF addons.
Well I feel silly now &amp;#8211; having updated&amp;#8230; Things seem to be as smooth as possible and FF is much more responsive. YAY MOZILLA!</description>

attacks and got hosed last weekend. The attack seems fairly
sophisticated (imo) and is described in this post.

      <description>Breast milk contains stem cells &amp;#8211; Monday, 11 February 2008 &amp;#8211; By Catherine Madden
 The Perth scientist who made the world-first discovery that human breast milk contains stem cells is confident that within five years scientists will be harvesting them to research treatment for conditions as far-reaching as spinal injuries, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease.
But what Dr Mark Cregan is excited about right now is the promise that his discovery could be the start of many more exciting revelations about the potency of breast milk.</description>

So, I know I spend X% on food and Y% on rent&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;ve been nothing but impressed.
There&amp;#8217;s also a &amp;#8220;how to save money&amp;#8221; section which strikes me as advertising and I&amp;#8217;ve dutifully ignored it.</description>

 The Google Analytics Reporting suite is an Adobe AIR application that brings&amp;nbsp;Google Analytics&amp;nbsp;to the desktop. It uses it’s own custom API to interact with Google and nearly implements all features of Analytics. See the feature list for more info.</description>

 Understand your nerd’s relation to the computer. It’s clichéd, but a nerd is defined by his computer, and you need to understand why.
First, a majority of the folks on the planet either have no idea how
a computer works or they look at it and think “it’s magic”.</description>

      <description>As Douglas Adams put, humans really can&amp;#8217;t deal with having a sense of proportion.&amp;nbsp; We aren&amp;#8217;t capable.&amp;nbsp; But we can stretch for it&amp;#8230;
(I can touch my toes, but I can&amp;#8217;t bend further over&amp;#8230; but I should try to)
Take 5 minutes and read this fantastic piece on an image from Hubble Ultra Deep Field.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a great reminder of what we know about space and a few tools to help you start to realize that you can&amp;#8217;t ever come close to grasping a true sense of proportion.</description>

  PHP 4 has served the web developer community for seven years now, and

shortcomings have been addressed by PHP 5, released three years ago,

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been using the &amp;#8220;Control Suite&amp;#8221; for a couple of development projects and I&amp;#8217;m 100% pleased.&amp;nbsp; The tools are modular (so you can take what you want), class based (so they don&amp;#8217;t break your other code), well documented, fast, easy, and clean.
Anyone who works with/develops AJAX and a dynamic web-user-interface&amp;#8230; especially if you already use prototype&amp;#8230; I highly recommend you try this set of tools.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve switched all my personal email to gmail, and have been using it for a couple of years now (i think).
But, I have work emails which I can not just forward (or would get confusing if I did).&amp;nbsp; So, of course, I use Thunderbird &amp;#8211; which is perfect&amp;#8230; but it doesn&amp;#8217;t have a calendar.
Well, now it does.
Check out this tutorial which gives an overview of 2 different plugins which allow 2-way communication between thunderbird and your google calendar.</description>

      <description>So, due to a degraded HDD in my RAID5 array, I decided to build a new array.
I bought 4 320G Seagate drives&amp;#8230; those drives have many benifits, not least of which, a 5 year warranty.
I already have a 3ware escalade RAID controller (7506-4LP), one of the best options for a hardware RAID controller.
Instead of building another RAID5, I chose to build 2, RAID1 arrays. I chose this because it&amp;#8217;s much easier to buy 2 hard drives (upgrading one mirrored pair) than to buy 4 hard drives (to upgrade a 4 disk array).</description>

      <description>Ran into a problem installing the 3DM2 (3ware raid management tool) on Ubuntu today.
Got an &amp;#8220;&amp;#8221; error when trying to run the install script.
After a bit of debugging, I figured out that the failing variable was in the &amp;#8220;check architecture&amp;#8221; section of the script&amp;#8230; In my case, I simply stripped out the logic and put in the following text to just set variables to my specific setup:

Simply, it&amp;#8217;s a brilliant option for listen to music.&amp;nbsp; You go to that site, create an ID (only requires an email address) and you get a personalized (personalizable) streaming radio station determined from a seed artist or song.
How does it know what music to select?&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s made by the people who did the music gennome project, so they have littereally mapped and classified music (fairly well, it seems) and allow you to guide your station(s) accordingly&amp;#8230; bring in variety or isolate to a single vein; the choice is yours&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;</description>

kinda neat&amp;#8230; to see that almost everything links to &amp;#8220;violence&amp;#8221; and that the &amp;#8220;united church of christ&amp;#8221; links only to &amp;#8220;churches&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;television&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;advertising&amp;#8221;.

Anyway &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s my excuse for being slow to jump on this bandwagon&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;m here now.
The only question is deciding if I want to make the switch and pay for an unlimited account&amp;#8230; then move all the photos I have in gallery into flickr&amp;#8230; and worry about when their server goes down or looses all of my photos (not that such is likely, but less under my control).</description>

what?&amp;nbsp;
If you could dis-allow it, do so.&amp;nbsp; If your plan is put into effect, that means more spam in the inbox.&amp;nbsp; It makes no sense.&amp;nbsp; (links below)

Those of you who still run into problems with adware and spyware, you might want to try this app out&amp;#8230; it couldn&amp;#8217;t hurt (unless it was a really clever double-agent type scam to get you to install it. no &amp;#8211; i don&amp;#8217;t think it is&amp;#8230;.. yes, it might be.</description>

      <description>I have looked for this information before, but the planets have aligned and I was able to find what I was looking for.
Here are complete instructions for how to download Real Audio streams and convert them to MP3 (or really, whatever) format:
 Windows Linux  Note: there is actually much more useful information on those pages if you were interested.
The tool for Windows is Flashget and for Linux, it&amp;#8217;s simply mplayer.</description>

      <description>I got a phone call today, supposedly from DomainRegistry.com.
Unfortunately, though suspicious, I did provide my street address&amp;#8230; I resisted, but he read it off to me, and I confirmed it&amp;#8230; what are you gonna do? Also, I suppose he knows my phone number, since he called me on it.
Then he gave me the 800 number 800-591-7398 (8005917398) as a number to find out more about what they are offering.</description>

      <description>Anyone else getting a flood of blog comment spam recently?
WordPress is awesome enough to catch all of it as probably spam and put it into a moderation queue for me, but I still had 80+ comments to delete in the past week&amp;#8230; and I have to be careful not to delete a non-spam comment&amp;#8230; not a good situation.
So I looked into plug-ins for WordPress and found a few, but the one I liked the most is called bad behavior.</description>

      <title>New template for za</title>
      <link>https://zeroasterisk.com/2005/11/21/new-template-for-za/</link>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2005/11/21/new-template-for-za/</guid>
      <description>So &amp;#8211; the new template is up on zeroasterisk. Not only does it look different right now &amp;#8211; this template is setup to be controlled by CSS, so I&amp;#8217;ll be providing options on how to view the site. Until I offer those options (look in the top right hand corner of the page for them) you&amp;#8217;ll have to make due with this one.
Also, I&amp;#8217;ve updated to gallery 2 and mediawiki&amp;#8230; The wiki update means little to any users, but the gallery update may effect anyone who uses my gallery.</description>

      <title>M$ Clusters – what a bad idea</title>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2005/11/16/m-clusters-what-a-bad-idea/</guid>
      <description>So now M$ is releaseing a version meant to cluster computers, you know, like a beowulf cluster.&amp;nbsp; This is one of the worst Ideas I could think of.&amp;nbsp;
Why would you use a flaky, high-overhead,&amp;nbsp;and often to crash OS to run distrobuted processing? There is no good reason, in my opinion. If you are willing to dedicate multiple computers to be a &amp;ldquo;super-computer&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; you should be willing to hire a linux geek to setup and run the thing for you&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; if you wanted to run windows, you don&amp;rsquo;t need a super-computer.</description>

      <description>There is a beta of a site that allows anyone to create a group, and people can add themselves / photos to it, and where they are at&amp;#8230; it uses google maps API to plot the photos on a map&amp;#8230; really neat stuff in my opinion&amp;#8230; so anyone who wants to spend 2 minutes to see if they are even mildly impressed / interested / entertained&amp;#8230; go to http://www.frappr.com/zeroasterisk and &amp;#8220;add yourself&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>My boss just sent me a link to the following article:
 PHP catching on at enterprises, vying with Java Not only is it cool my boss sent it to me, but the content of the article is great news for anyone who is a fan of PHP&amp;#8230; (and anyone who doesn&amp;#8217;t know if they are or not, I very much am&amp;#8230; so if you can&amp;#8217;t form your own opinion on the topic, you may borrow mine) As more and more businesses realize the power, flexibility, and simplicity of PHP &amp;#8211; as it comes into the mainstream more and more &amp;#8211; I get more chances to work with it, teach friends about it, get paid to build stuff with it&amp;#8230; etc.</description>

      <description>A quick note about techno-passports which are to be common soon (required I believe)&amp;#8230; they put an antenna in the passport, to transmit data, and a material on the cover to stop the antenna from transmitting all time&amp;#8230; strange? yes. this is of importance to people like April who are always (or at least often) using their passports&amp;#8230; I bet it&amp;#8217;s a few years yet before anita or I have to think about it.</description>

      <description>I feel like a spectator admiring athletes reading things like the this blog post [Semantic Wikipedia - At last one of dreams is at the verge of coming true.], but an excited spectator, none the less.
Wiki is already a fantastic tool for simple (or complex) content management, accessible to anyone within a few minutes&amp;#8230; This proposed innovation would add the ability to add, inline, extra relationships which build a more complete (and interoperable) logical structure.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a comprehensive theme, currently called za1 (very exciting name, eh?).&amp;nbsp; I will be mapping the components of my site into that theme (instead of hacking the themes of the components of my site to look kindof like each other).
The themes are driven primarily by CSS, and done in such a way as to allow simple variations in how things should look&amp;hellip; there will be an &amp;ldquo;options&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;selector on the top-right and it will allow you to easily choose theme options and it saves your options as a cookie (if you allow the cookie) or session variables if your don&amp;rsquo;t allow the cookies.</description>

      <description>So &amp;#8211; Capture the Flag was a lot of fun. We played at the Park of Roses on August 21 2005 (after sundown). We had 9 people show and had a great time, though we were out classed severely by some &amp;#8220;in shape&amp;#8221; players. I&amp;#8217;m hoping to end up with more people in a bigger area for the next game on September 9th (friday) at an unknown location.
Google is incredible.</description>
