I have implemented a blogging system on my site (utilizing [WordPress][1]) and modified the display of my wiki to _play well_ with the blog&#8230; The basics of the change are making the content fixed width, and moving the &#8220;article, discussion, edit, history, etc&#8221; tabs to a sidebar component on the wiki&#8230; then coming up with a shared header&#8230;

I still need to get the old blog entries into this system (very do-able), and I am thinking a homepage not in the wiki, is appropriate&#8230; either that or i should get rid of the &#8220;home&#8221; link in the header&#8230; hurumph &#8211; i think i&#8217;m going to remove the &#8220;home&#8221; link in the header now (since it&#8217;s the same as the wiki link for now).

I also plan on improving the image in the header&#8230; but i can only do a few things at a time&#8230;
