Looking at the following article:

[Indian-born scientist developing coated DVD&#8217;s that can make hard disks obsolete][1]

..: I find my self thinking that hard drives wouldn&#8217;t be obsolete, but OS installations might be.&nbsp; Already there are many LiveCD installations of Linux and Windows, which don&#8217;t require a Hard Drive at all, but simply boot to the CD/DVD&#8230; With more sophisitication and personalization options (there are already setups where you can store personalizations on a USB flash drive or something) I think the idea of a static state OS would be very appealing.&nbsp; Think about never having to reinstall windows &#8211; ever!&nbsp; Never being worried about a virus which could damage the OS&#8230; sure, your profile data might be in jeapordy, installed programs&#8230; but the OS could be 100% seperate.&nbsp; Given that seperation, backing up personal data would become easier and hopefully more common (how many people mean to do so, but never do?).
