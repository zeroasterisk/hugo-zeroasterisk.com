I feel like I should have something profound to say.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been a supporter since I picked up one of his books and have grown more so as I&#8217;ve found out more and more about Obama and his family and views and campaign.

We watched the results at our friend&#8217;s house and were ready to cry together, but thankfully we didn&#8217;t have to.&nbsp; After the last two presidential elections, I was pessimistic and ready to be disappointed &#8211; when Obama won I really had to do a couple of reality checks.&nbsp; I&#8217;m still amazed to live in a world where we have elected Obama.

On the whole, I&#8217;m very hopeful.&nbsp; As a country, we are ready for a &#8220;new deal&#8221; type of paradigm shift and we&#8217;ve elected someone capable of effecting that change in a positive and beneficial way.&nbsp; I keep saying that I feel naive to be so hopeful, but I am.&nbsp; 

There has been a flurry of wonderful information, reflections and projections by many different people about Obama and the upcoming presidency.&nbsp; Here are some great Fresh Air shows:
