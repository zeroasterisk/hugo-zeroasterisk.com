**Katrina**

It&rsquo;s a [huge disaster][1].&nbsp; Everyone is probably aware of that.&nbsp; To put it in perspective, it&rsquo;s [**Katrina**

It&rsquo;s a [huge disaster][1].&nbsp; Everyone is probably aware of that.&nbsp; To put it in perspective, it&rsquo;s][2] many other natural and un-natural disasters other countries or even this country has had to deal with ([or cause][3])&hellip; but it&rsquo;s still really bad. [[the worst hurricanes]][4]

So, we use this as an opportunity to blame other people and talk about who should have done what and why we weren&rsquo;t prepaired and aren&rsquo;t handling the situation well now [[link]][5].&nbsp; Aside from the blame assignments, it is kinda bad that we weren&rsquo;t prepaired for this.&nbsp; It was a&nbsp;serious hurricain, but that isn&rsquo;t an unknown possibility&hellip;&nbsp; we have been prepaired for things like this before&hellip; why weren&rsquo;t we better prepaired now? are we going to be? [[San Fran perspective]][6]

**Space Elevator**

And on a lighter note, a [space elevator site][7] which i think is really cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;re looking forward to a the probable use of &ldquo;carbon-nanotube-composite ribbon&rdquo; [[1]][8]&nbsp;for structural strength and beautiful, simple (complex) physics for functionality.&nbsp; Heck, it was even [on NPR][9], must be [bona-fide][10].
