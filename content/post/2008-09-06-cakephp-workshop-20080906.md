So here I am, in Raleigh, NC &#8211; waiting for the [CakePHP Workshop][1] to start&#8230; We survived the rain so far, waiting to see if there is any flooding or whatnot.

Have met a few people here so far, all seem very friendly. Looking forward to seeing what happens and what we learn along the way.

I am wearing my &#8220;I [heart] LAMP&#8221; geek-shirt today, as it seemed appropriate (if a little over the top nerdy).
