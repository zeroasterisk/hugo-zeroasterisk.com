[home of the nerd cave | taskbar shuffle and more][1]:
  


> Once you download, install, and run Taskbar Shuffle, left-click and drag the programs/buttons on your Windows taskbar to rearrange them.&nbsp; It&#8217;s that easy. </p>
This is a great tool for those (like me) who usually have over a dozen applications they need to keep open at the same time for work or whatever&#8230; thus, you don&#8217;t have to hunt as hard for the open program you need to find.

Thanks to [Jason][2] for this link, and thanks to the developer(s) {Jay&nbsp;E?}
