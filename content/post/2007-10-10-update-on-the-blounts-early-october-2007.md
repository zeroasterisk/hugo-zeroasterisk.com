So, I&#8217;ve been remiss to put anything about us on here recently.&nbsp; I&#8217;m thinking that I might split the blog into two seperate blogs&#8230; one on the Blounts, and one on general stuff I feel like talking about&#8230; 2 weeks.&nbsp; (the perpetual two weeks)

Anyway&#8230;

Anita&#8217;s very pregnant&#8230; always holding her belly and still, gloriously asymptomatic.&nbsp; She&#8217;s working at a low cost mdeical center pharmacy for this month&#8217;s rotation.&nbsp; not very interesting for her.&nbsp; Last month was [Central State hospital][1] and she liked that a lot.&nbsp; She&#8217;s done some projects/presentations at both places to great review, I hear.&nbsp;

We&#8217;ve moved into a [new house][2], belonging to [Jason Chili][3]&#8230; it&#8217;s a wonderful house with a lot of stuff in it (ours and his).&nbsp; Once we got it a bit more organized, it&#8217;s been a joy to be there.
