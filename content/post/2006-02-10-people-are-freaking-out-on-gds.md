I&#8217;m seeing a lot of articles (and people at work are linking me to even more) warning people about the new [Google Desktop Search][1]; like: [Google Copies Your Hard Drive &#8211; Government Smiles in Anticipation][2]



> Google today announced a new &#8220;feature&#8221; of its Google Desktop software that greatly increases the risk to consumer privacy. If a consumer chooses to use it, the new &#8220;Search Across Computers&#8221; feature will store copies of the user&#8217;s Word documents, PDFs, spreadsheets and other text-based documents on Google&#8217;s own servers, to enable searching from any one of the user&#8217;s computers. EFF urges consumers not to use this feature, because it will make their personal data more vulnerable to subpoenas from the government and possibly private litigants, while providing a convenient one-stop-shop for hackers who&#8217;ve obtained a user&#8217;s Google password.</p>
Though, I do agree that the search across computers isn&#8217;t a feature most people will have any need for and opens serious security concerns&#8230; it isn&#8217;t a big deal&#8230; why?&nbsp; Because it can EASILY be turned off.&nbsp; There is no mysterious configuration required&#8230; when you install the new version of GDS, it asks you if you want to turn the search across computers feature on and then explains what that means.&nbsp; This is not complicated configurations nor tweaking nor reading fine print&#8230; we&#8217;re talking a very simple page of <8 options (this feature being one of those options).

Get a grip.&nbsp; Read the screen.&nbsp; Uncheck the box.&nbsp;

And yes, I have a bandwidth monitor and didn&#8217;t notice any transfers which would make me concerned on either of the computers I have installed it on thus far.
