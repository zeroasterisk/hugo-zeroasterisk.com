[Engineered cells beat cancer in human test | Chicago Tribune][1]:



> In a small study of patients with terminal skin cancer, Maryland scientists have demonstrated for the first time that genetically engineered immune cells can kill off large tumors.</p>
>
> The research, conducted by a team at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, remains highly experimental, and it worked on just two of the 17 patients in the study.
>
> But excited government scientists said it is the first time gene therapy has vanquished an advanced cancer. More important, the technique could serve as a potent new assault weapon against breast, lung and other, more common cancers, researchers said.
