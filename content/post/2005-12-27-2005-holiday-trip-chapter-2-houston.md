I spent many full and well populated days in Houston. Anita and I spent nights at various family houses, ate some of the best food we had eaten all year, and most importantly &#8211; got to spend good time with our family together.

Here are some of the highlights:

  * Great quality time with family (can&#8217;t mention it enough &#8211; strange that just spending time is so important, so simple, and so rare)
  * Got to meet Scott&#8217;s girlfriend, Ilah (ee-lah)
  * Good but sad visits with my grandmother [Penny][1] (aka Grandma&#8217; Penny)
  * Games played : rummykub, canasta, hearts, pictionary, balderdash, ping pong (I won at ping-pong and sometime I won at canasta, but lost everything else)
  * Food, food, and food (including some [mango salsa][2] I made, which everyone appeared to appreciate)
  * Ikea blitz &#8211; a 1 hour run through ikea resulting in a total bill of less than $150 for Anita and myself (incredible for us consumer sheep)

One of the important parts which gets a bit of a review is my visit with my grandmother &#8220;Penny&#8221;, who has [Alzheimer&#8217;s][3]. She has been bed-ridden for 5 years now, and unable to really communicate for over 10 years (or so). Luckily she is taken care of better than any could hope (if interested on details for a Houston location, feel free to email me), but it&#8217;s still shocking to see her survive&#8230; She can smile and express with her eyebrows. She will stutter syllables sometimes, attempting to say something, but almost definitely not a collected thought. She can see and remember well enough to light up occasionally, when she sees members of her family and we even got a laugh on an offhand remark on the family trait of my &#8220;Pennington nose&#8221;&#8230; but it&#8217;s still sad beyond measure. It&#8217;s an enduring and helpless loss; the loss of almost everything that she used to be: intelligent, refined, strong, funny, and striking.

I have not yet decided 100%, if I would want someone to kill me if I was in that state&#8230; but I probably would; I imagine I would then too, but wouldn&#8217;t be able to communicate it. It would just be difficult (impossible) for my family to let me go. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve noticed &#8211; there is enough of G&#8217;ma Penny in there, that we all relate to her as if she wasn&#8217;t lost&#8230;. as if she wasn&#8217;t behind inches of frosted glass, translucent with the plaque in her brain.

And on that happy note, that&#8217;s the end of my visit to Houston&#8230; back to Louisville.
