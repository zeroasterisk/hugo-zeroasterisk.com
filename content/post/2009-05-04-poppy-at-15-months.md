  <span><span>Poppy is doing great.  She&#8217;s wearing the overalls which were rolling up so that they didn&#8217;t drag, only 3 months ago&#8230; now they are high-water-ready, ending up above her ankle.  </span></span>

  <span><span>She&#8217;s certainly got an attitude and is already testing boundaries and figuring out what she can get away with.  More so right now, as her i-teeth are coming in, all four at once.  But though she doesn&#8217;t understand it yet, we&#8217;ve started with some time-outs&#8230; basically just to make sure she knows that it&#8217;s bad and not a game when we tell her &#8220;no&#8221;.</span></span>

  <span><span>We had a great visit when &#8220;Granny C&#8221; came to town.  We are pretty much always busy, but it was in high gear for the week she was here.  A few friends ran the marathon (in under 4 hours) and we cheered them on in a couple of places and at the end, there was a hot air balloon glow and we got up early to watch the hot air balloon race (mostly an excuse to watch all the balloons get blown up and take off, more fun to watch than you might think).  There was always something going on, there always is.</span></span>
