There&#8217;s a [great video][1] done by Dan Harris of ABC news on the Mates of State and what the family does when they go on tour.

I love the wholesomeness of it and it fits right in with what I think they would be like.&nbsp; This band is one of my absolute favorites and that&#8217;s only encouraged by this peak into their good parenting and family priorities.
