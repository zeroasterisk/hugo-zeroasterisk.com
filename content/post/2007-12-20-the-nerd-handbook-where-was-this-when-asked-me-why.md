It&#8217;s long, but great &#8211; go read the [Nerd Handbook][1] and understand your favorite nerds just a bit more. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a quote from the top: 

****

> Understand your nerd’s relation to the computer. It’s clichéd, but a nerd is defined by his computer, and you need to understand why.
> 
> First, a majority of the folks on the planet either have no idea how
  
> a computer works or they look at it and think “it’s magic”. Nerds know
  
> how a computer works. They intimately know how a computer works. When
  
> you ask a nerd, “When I click this, it takes awhile for the thing to
  
> show up. Do you know what’s wrong?” they know what’s wrong. A nerd has
  
> a mental model of the hardware and the software in his head. While the
  
> rest of the world sees magic, your nerd knows how the magic works, he
  
> knows the magic is a long series of ones and zeros moving across your
  
> screen with impressive speed, and he knows how to make those bits move
  
> faster. 
> 
> The nerd has based his career, maybe his life, on the computer, and as
  
> we’ll see, this intimate relationship has altered his view of the
  
> world. He sees the world as a system which, given enough time and
  
> effort, is completely knowable. This is a fragile illusion that your
  
> nerd has adopted, but it’s a pleasant one that gets your nerd through
  
> the day. When the illusion is broken, you are going to discover that…
