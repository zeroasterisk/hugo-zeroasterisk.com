[Rwandans look to Louisville for interfaith model][1]

> The Rwandans invited the center&#8217;s executive director, Jan Arnow, to visit their country, where in May, she conducted workshops and discussions with a group that included various faiths, from Muslims to Catholics to Quakers to Pentecostals.
>
> During that visit, she said, group members told her, &#8220;We want to do what your organization does&#8221; &#8212; leading to establishment of the center&#8217;s first branch outside Kentucky.
>
> &#8220;They recognized that what they needed to do was create an interfaith organization under the umbrella of which they could do this work,&#8221; Arnow said, adding the Rwandan group will be run entirely by people in that nation but is using the Louisville branch as a model.
