<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Poppy has started really reaching for people when she wants to be held.&nbsp; She also now will usually kiss whomever is holding her.&nbsp; That kiss is often with an open mouth and extended tounge, but we&#8217;re not picky &#8211; it counts!</p> 

<p>
  You can tell she wants to stand all the time.&nbsp; She&#8217;s pulling up on stuff and getting her balance and letting go with both hands, usually to fall in a second or on a good day, two&#8230; but she keeps her balance well sitting and fairly well standing.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll be walking her soon, to be sure.

<p>
  Her talking is still just babbling, but it&#8217;s come a ways, as well&#8230; <br /></span>
