excerpt: "I took the kittens to the vet yesterday.  It turns out they're only 6 weeks old and they are both males.  We have also decided on names for them.  The black one is henceforth Thebe, and the white and orange one is Io.  These are the names of 2 of Jupiter's moons, so we were able to stick with the science theme afterall!  "

I took the kittens to the vet yesterday. It turns out they&#8217;re only 6 weeks old and they are both males. We have also decided on names for them. The black one is henceforth [Thebe][1], and the white and orange one is [Io][2]. These are the names of 2 of Jupiter&#8217;s moons, so we were able to stick with the science theme afterall!


 [1]: /w/Thebe
 [2]: /w/Io
