Our daughter is 5 months old today. The milestones of time help me take account of the monumental changes which have happened. We have a fully fledged baby &#8211; nobody would call her an infant&#8230; she will never be an infant again.

This is both wonderful and tragic &#8211; but luckily more on the wonderful side.

She&#8217;s starting to teeth occasionally, but it seems to bother her for a couple of days here and there. She can sit up or stand up while hanging on to something. Everyone loves her and she&#8217;s still like kryptonite &#8211; making even non-baby-lovers weak in the knees.

She&#8217;s eating sweet potatoes and green beans so far &#8211; enjoying both of them and wanting more.

Unfortunately she&#8217;s been talking a bit less this month. We got a few consonants in there, but she&#8217;s vocalized a bit less over all. Oh well &#8211; at least she&#8217;s still laughing a lot.
