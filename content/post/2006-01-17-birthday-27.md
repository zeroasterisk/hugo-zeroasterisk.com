It my (Alan&#8217;s) 27th birthday today.

Thanks to all who have sent cards, emails, IMs, phone calls, etc to wish me a happy one. I&#8217;m rather surprised so many people have remembered. Also, special thanks to the &#8220;check givers&#8221;&#8230; all that money is going into savings to replenish the money that was withdrawn to pay for our new bed (soon to arrive).

I&#8217;m surprised to see that so many people sent jokes (or at least comments) about how old I was getting. I&#8217;ve got candle makers collapsing under strain and solar glare from all the candles on my cake&#8230; So, when I&#8217;m 28, do I get a walker.

You should all know, it&#8217;s funny when I joke about how old I am&#8230; but mean when anyone else does. (that was a joke)

It&#8217;s also Genna&#8217;s first birthday who apparently said &#8220;roahlenght&#8221;&#8230; which, according to parental translation, means &#8220;happy birthday big al&#8221;.

And it&#8217;s Chandra&#8217;s 24th (i think) birthday.

Last night I had my christmas dinner&#8230; we went out to Tyfoon (I know it should be typhoon) for half-priced sushi and still dropped $45 on 7 rolls of great sushi. It was great.

Work as usual today, I didn&#8217;t get off early, and in fact worked late&#8230;.. such is life.
