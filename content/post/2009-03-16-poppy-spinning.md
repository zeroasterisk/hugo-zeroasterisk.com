She has just started spinning around in circles to get herself dizzy.  

It&#8217;s one of the cutest things I&#8217;ve ever witnessed.

The downside is that she already staggers like a drunk anytime she&#8217;s tired and sometimes when she&#8217;s not&#8230; so this just adds to the appearance that she is seconds away from being face-down on the ground.  

Oh well, she puts up with the bumps and bruises admirably.
