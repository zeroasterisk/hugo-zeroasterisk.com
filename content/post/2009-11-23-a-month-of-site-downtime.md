So the website has been down from Oct 21st to Nov 23rd.  The old server got hacked (or really, a sister-server) and due to security concerns, we didn&#8217;t know what got owned and what was safe.  We already had a different server hardware to put in place, just had to set it up.  So we got that installed and up and running, but it took me a few more days to get around to implementing something on my site.

I&#8217;ve switched to a WordPress controlled homepage, and I think I&#8217;m going to abandon the wiki (as opposed to simply not posting anything in it).

That is all&#8230;

Thanks,
