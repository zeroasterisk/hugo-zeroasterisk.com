I just heard from my good friend (and former employer) [Dave Caudill][1] and got up to speed on his recent [newsletters][2].&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad to see he&rsquo;s still making great art and getting it out in the world&hellip; It&rsquo;s also nice to hear the human side of the story, about the places he visits, what he sees, and often what he eats&hellip;&nbsp;

The most appealing of these recent travels, for me, is the [Grounds for Sculpture][3]&nbsp;in&nbsp;<!--StartFragment -->Hamilton, New Jersey (

[map][4]).&nbsp; According to Dave, it&rsquo;s one of the best sculpture displays he&rsquo;s ever seen.&nbsp; I am looking forward to an excuse to go see it&hellip;&nbsp; maybe for Anita&rsquo;s spring break.

Since we&rsquo;re on the subject of Sculpture &ndash; if anyone is interested in sculpture and havn&rsquo;t looked at one of my favorites,&nbsp;[Isamu Noguchi][5], please do so.&nbsp; Also &ndash; if interested in a local (Louisville) struggling and talented sculptor, checkout [Myra Silva][6], a friend of mine who also works as a carpenter and a general bad-ass (in my opinion).

**Now playing:** [Mates of State][7] &#8211; [Team Boo &#8211; Middle Is Gold][8]
