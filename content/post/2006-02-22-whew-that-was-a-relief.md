The [Would You Have Been a Nazi Test][1]




> Achtung! You are 23% brainwashworthy, 18% antitolerant, and 28% blindly patriotic
>
> Congratulations! You are not susceptible to brainwashing, your values and cares extend beyond the borders of your own country, and your Blind Patriotism does not reach unhealthy levels. If you had been German in the 30s, you would&#8217;ve left the country. One bad scenario &#8212; as I hypothetically project you back in time &#8212; is that you just wouldn&#8217;t have cared one way or the other about Nazism. Maybe politics don&#8217;t interest you enough. But the fact that you took this test means they probably do. I&#8217;m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt. Did you know that many of the smartest Germans departed prior to the beginning of World War II, because they knew some evil shit was brewing? Brain Drain. Many of them were scientists. It is very possible you could have been one of them. Conclusion: born and raised in Germany in the early 1930&#8217;s, you would not have been a Nazi.
