Poppy is:

  * walking well, though she still staggers like she&#8217;s drunk when she&#8217;s tired.
  * sometimes eating vegetables, often not &#8211; but always eating fruit and crackers are much better
  * starting to learn a few signs&#8230; she&#8217;s known &#8220;more&#8221; for a while now, but now she can do eat and drink and occasionally a few others.
  * certainly understands many words and phrases and tones of voice, and is starting to mimic more often&#8230; sometimes putting a word in context a bit&#8230; though it&#8217;s a stretch and only her family would recognize these accomplishments.
  * has spent a few days at daycare (when both anita and alan are working and sarah is not available to babysit), enough to hate to be dropped off <img src="http://zeroasterisk.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
  * loves showing off her belly and pointing to it&#8230; then she&#8217;ll lift up your shirt and point at your belly, or just wait for you to give her belly a raspberry
  * sleeps through the night for the most part, but wakes up early in the morning ~5 to nurse and then sleeps again till ~7
  * sometimes naps twice a day, sometimes once &#8211; rarely the old standard of three times
