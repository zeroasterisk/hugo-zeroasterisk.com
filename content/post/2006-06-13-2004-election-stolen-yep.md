[Was the 2004 Election Stolen?][1]

_Republicans prevented more than 350,000 voters in Ohio from casting ballots or having their votes counted &#8212; enough to have put John Kerry in the White House._ BY [ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR][2].

This is a great article, full of well cited and reasoned points&#8230; pointing towards a conclusion which may well get you branded as a conspiracy theorist&#8230; but still seems the most likely explanation.

> But what is most anomalous about the irregularities in 2004 was their decidedly partisan bent: Almost without exception they hurt John Kerry and benefited George Bush. After carefully examining the evidence, I&#8217;ve become convinced that the president&#8217;s party mounted a massive, coordinated campaign to subvert the will of the people in 2004. Across the country, Republican election officials and party stalwarts employed a wide range of illegal and unethical tactics to fix the election. A review of the available data reveals that in Ohio alone, at least 357,000 voters, the overwhelming majority of them Democratic, were prevented from casting ballots or did not have their votes counted in 2004(12) &#8212; more than enough to shift the results of an election decided by 118,601 votes.(13) (See [Ohio&#8217;s Missing Votes][3]) In what may be the single most astounding fact from the election, one in every four Ohio citizens who registered to vote in 2004 showed up at the polls only to discover that they were not listed on the rolls, thanks to GOP efforts to stem the unprecedented flood of Democrats eager to cast ballots.(14) And that doesn?t even take into account the troubling evidence of outright fraud, which indicates that upwards of 80,000 votes for Kerry were counted instead for Bush. That alone is a swing of more than 160,000 votes &#8212; enough to have put John Kerry in the White House.(15)
