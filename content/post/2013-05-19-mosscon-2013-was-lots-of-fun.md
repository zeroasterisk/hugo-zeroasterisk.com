I had a great time attending and presenting at moscon.

<http://mosscon.org/>

May 18 &#8211; 19, 2013 | University of Louisville | Louisville, Kentucky

I know it was a lot of work for the people who set it up, but you did a great job and I look forward to attending again in another year.

(if I present again next time, my slides will be more readable, I promise&#8230;)
