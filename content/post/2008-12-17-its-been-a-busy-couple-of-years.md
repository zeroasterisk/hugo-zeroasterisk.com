<div>
  We were talking about this recently and we realized that in the past two years:
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  We have&nbsp;lived in 5 different places (our apt in Columbus, Anita&#8217;s mom&#8217;s for a few months, Chili&#8217;s house for almost a year, Houston with my family for a couple of months, and finally our new house)
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I have&nbsp;worked 6 positions in 3 companies, not counting consulting gigs on the side. &nbsp;During that time I worked in 5 different offices (mostly due to the moves mentioned above).
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Anita has&nbsp;
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      taken cumulative finals in classes
    </li>
    <li>
      done a year of on-site internships at all manner of pharmacies in 2 states while pregnant and then with a newborn
    </li>
    <li>
      gave birth sometime in there
    </li>
    <li>
      studied for and taken her state and national liscenure boards and passed them
    </li>
    <li>
      and started a new job as a pharmacist for the first time
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  And most importantly, we have been learning how to be parents to Poppy. &nbsp; And that keeps changing on us weekly, it seems.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It&#8217;s been a busy time.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  If we seem frazzled, there&#8217;s a good reason.
