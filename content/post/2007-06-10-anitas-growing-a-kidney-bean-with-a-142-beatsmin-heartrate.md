The &#8220;lil&#8217; nug&#8221; inside Anita is currently the size of a kidney bean.&nbsp; The organs have all begun developing and the heart is beating strong, at 142 beats/min.&nbsp; Bloodwork and whatnot seem fine.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got very uninformative ultrasound images which I may get scanned and post sometime&#8230;

We&#8217;re still both pretty attached to the name &#8220;Ruby&#8221; for a girl.&nbsp; Not sure about a boys name.
