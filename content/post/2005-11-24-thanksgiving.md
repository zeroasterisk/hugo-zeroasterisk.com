Here is my requisite turkeyday post. Anita had to work her last day today, so we are in Columbus still. She plans on not working until this summer. I&#8217;ve been encouraging her to do this&#8230; though her ~10 hours of work a week doesn&#8217;t sound like much, since she does ~60 hours a week of school work &#8211; a few extra hours to relax would be welcome.

We will be driving to Louisville tonight after anita is off work. I&#8217;ll keep myself awake listening to the harry potter audiobooks&#8230; I&#8217;ve read the books, but have recently hooked myself on the audiobooks&#8230; I&#8217;ve been listening to them while cleaning and doing stuff around the house.

It was my grandfather&#8217;s ([Jack Pennington][2]) 85th birthday on Tuesday. I hear the celebration was great as was the turn-out. Here are [some photos][3] sent by my mom.

We will remain in Louisville until Tuesday night. I have some meetings to go to in the Louisville office on Tuesday and it seemed to make sense to just stay. Work is really busy these days, as we have a lot of things to get done before December 3rd&#8230; hopefully things chill out a bit after that. I also hope I&#8217;ll feel better soon. I&#8217;m not sick, I&#8217;m sore. 

[Phil][4] and some of his friends and I played football yesterday in the snow. It was a lot of fun, but they &#8220;upgraded&#8221; to tackle football. I would normally bow out, but these were guys we&#8217;ve played with many times and were all really friendly &#8211; so I stayed and played. It was a fun set of games but I am so sore. Wierdly, on the only time I really fell hard I had the strangest and strongest sense of deja-vu when I hit the ground. Luckily, nothing bad happened, no lasting or major injuries&#8230; but I am still sore. (old man)
