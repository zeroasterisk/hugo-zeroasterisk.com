[CNN.com &#8211; GOP split as Senate panel bucks Bush on terror tribunals &#8211; Sep 15, 2006][1]:



> The bill was backed by Republican Sens. John Warner of Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
>
> It differs from the administration&#8217;s proposal in two major ways: It would permit terror suspects to view classified evidence against them and does not include a proposal that critics say reinterprets a Geneva Conventions rule that prohibits cruel and inhuman treatment of detainees.

Bascially we are saying that we are trying to pass a bill that doesn&#8217;t reinterprit (abolish) elements of the Geneva Convention.&nbsp; Who are these people?&nbsp; Who would really want to reduce the little humanity we have tried to impose, on human-kind?&nbsp; Oh, yeah&#8230; our government.
