An [excellent article on Walmart being evil or not][1] &#8211; a fairly objective seeming overview of the major points of discussion for the different camps on Walmart.

> That&#8217;s a good thing, right? If a company achieves its lower prices by finding better and smarter ways of doing things, then yes, everybody wins. But if it cuts costs by cutting pay and benefits&#8211;or by sending production to China&#8211;then not everybody wins. And here&#8217;s where the story of Good Wal-Mart starts to falter. Just as its Everyday Low Prices benefit shoppers who&#8217;ve never come near a Wal-Mart, there are mounting signs that its Everyday Low Pay (Wal-Mart&#8217;s full-time hourly employees average $9.76 an hour) is hurting some workers who have never worked there. For example, unionized supermarkets in California&#8211;faced with studies showing a 13% to 16% drop in grocery prices after Wal-Mart enters a market&#8211;have been trying to slash labor costs to compete, triggering a protracted strike. The $15 billion in goods that Wal-Mart and its suppliers imported from China in 2003, meanwhile, accounted for nearly 11% of the U.S. total&#8211;contributing, some economists argue, to further erosion of U.S. wages.

> Where you stand on Wal-Mart, then, seems to depend on where you sit. If you&#8217;re a consumer, Wal-Mart is good for you. If you&#8217;re a wage earner, there&#8217;s a good chance it&#8217;s bad. If you&#8217;re a Wal-Mart shareholder, you want the company to grow. If you&#8217;re a citizen, you probably don&#8217;t want it growing in your backyard. So, which one are you?
