Poppy has stopped walking and is pretty much either running to places, or stumble-running.  I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s an exaggeration, but it is certainly what it seems like.

Likewise, she&#8217;s still babbling incoherently &#8211; but she&#8217;s doing so loudly.  Also &#8211; her speech patterns are much closer to English.  We don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s saying, but she sure does and, by god, she means it.  Her actual vocabulary has increased to maybe a dozen words and phrases:

mommy, daddy, papa, poppy, dog, milk, what&#8217;s that, what&#8217;s this, i got it, i want it, i want that&#8230; etc&#8230;

I read recently that by age two, about half of what a toddler says should be understandable by a stranger.  We are still a ways off, but making progress.
