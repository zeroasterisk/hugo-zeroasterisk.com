One sunny day in 2009 an old man approached the White House   
from across Pennsylvania Avenue, where he&#8217;d been sitting on a   
park bench. He spoke to the U.S. Marine standing guard and   
said, &#8216;I would like to go in and meet with President Bush.&#8217; 

The Marine looked at the man and said, &#8216;Sir, Mr. Bush is no longer   
president and no longer resides here.&#8217; 

The old man said, &#8216;Okay, thank you&#8217; and walked away. 

The following day, the same man approached the White House   
and said to the same Marine, &#8216;I would like to go in and meet with   
President Bush.&#8217; 

The Marine again told the man, &#8216;Sir, as I said yesterday, Mr.  
Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here.&#8217; 

The man thanked him and, again, just walked away. 

The third day, the same man approached the White House and   
spoke to the very same U. S. Marine, saying &#8216;I would like to go   
in and meet with President Bush.&#8217; 

The Marine, understandably agitated at this point, looked at   
the man and said, &#8216;Sir, this is the third day in a row you have   
been here asking to speak to Mr. Bush. I&#8217;ve told you already   
that Mr. Bush is no longer the president and no longer resides   
here. Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8217; 

The old man looked at the Marine and said, &#8216;Oh, I understand.   
I just love hearing it.&#8217; 

The Marine snapped to attention, saluted, and said, &#8216;See you   
tomorrow, Sir&#8217;.
