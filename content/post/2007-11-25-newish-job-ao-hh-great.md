I&#8217;ve been working part time for AudiologyOnline for months (after hours and on the weekends), and have finally started there full time as of Nov 15th. It&#8217;s been wonderful, not only has everyone been very nice and supportive, but I&#8217;ve ben able to jump in with both feet and get to work.

It&#8217;s meeting time central. I&#8217;m in LA for a conference on Local Search this week and in Dallas for a company meeting next week. Looking forward to getting some work done (when not at a meeting).
