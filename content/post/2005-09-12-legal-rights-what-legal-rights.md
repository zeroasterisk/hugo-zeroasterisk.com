[September 9th, it was ruled][1] that [Jose Padilla][2] was still not to be given fair trial, in fact not to be charged with a crime nor to be given legal council.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the first time this has ever happened in the US court system (to my knowledge)&hellip;&nbsp; Even actual &ldquo;[enemy combatants][3]&rdquo; in our previous wars, captured on the battlefield all got lawyers and full legal procedings.&nbsp; Our courts were used, to verify and justify and validate.&nbsp; Now we are tossing out the most fundimental rules of our system against a US citizen who has been held for over 3 years.

For more informaiton on this I **strongly** recommend you listen to at least the first act of the [This American Life][4] &ndash; [episode 229][5] called &ldquo;secret government&rdquo;.

I understand most people may be wary of honestly thinking our government is stripping away some of the foundations of our rights, while others are sure it&rsquo;s been happening for years.&nbsp; I fear&nbsp;I may be in the later category, but the Jose Padilla issue is one of the most prominently displayed suspension of rights for an American Citizen that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve heard of.&nbsp; Check out the [wikipedia article][2] on him for a discussion of the articles of the Geniva Convention which covers enemy combatants.
