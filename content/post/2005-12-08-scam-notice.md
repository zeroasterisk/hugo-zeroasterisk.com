I got a phone call today, supposedly from [DomainRegistry.com][1]. 

Unfortunately, though suspicious, I did provide my street address&#8230; I resisted, but he read it off to me, and I confirmed it&#8230; what are you gonna do? Also, I suppose he knows my phone number, since he called me on it.

Then he gave me the 800 number 800-591-7398 (8005917398) as a number to find out more about what they are offering.

I [searched][2] on that 800 number and found [the following thread][3] among other references to this being a scam. I just wanted to put the warning up, and keep the information out there.
