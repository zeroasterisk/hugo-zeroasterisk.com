A great but disturbing email sent by my friend Jason E. (spoon):

> November 14th, 2006: A student is tasered <span style="font-weight: bold;">five times</span> while in police custody while in the library at UCLA. The cops tase him, not because he&#8217;s fighting them, but because he is (non-violently) refusing to walk out of the library with them.&nbsp; Note that the cop says, &#8220;Stand up or you&#8217;ll get tased again.&#8221;&nbsp; 
> 
> Of anything on this video that comment really sickens me the most.&nbsp; If the student refuses to walk, the cops should have just carried him out, calling in back up if that&#8217;s what it takes to remove him.&nbsp; Repeatedly administering electric shocks to a person laying on the ground until he or she agrees to walk with you is torture.&nbsp; Straight up.

> October 13th, 2006: On a similar note, one of my favorite bands, the Two Gallants, a two piece from San Francisco, were playing a show in Houston last month.&nbsp; In the middle of their set, a lone cop walks onto the venue&#8217;s stage and grabs Adam&#8217;s guitar while he&#8217;s playing.&nbsp; The drummer, Tyson, approaches them to see what&#8217;s going on and the cop tackles both him and Adam simultaneously to the stage.&nbsp; Yeah, well, you&#8217;ll see; the cop is a huge guy and they&#8217;re skinny, little indie rockers.&nbsp; 
> 
> The cop gets off of them and calls for back up, then starts storming around the venue tasering people.&nbsp; He tasered at least four people (some of them multiple times) including Adam the guitarist, their stage manager, a fourteen year-old boy and the boy&#8217;s father.&nbsp; Several people were eventually arrested. 
> 
> Because the band is growing in popularity and because of the YouTube videos, the story has been reported on in several places including Rolling Stone and Pitchfork media.&nbsp; This site has everything about the incident including still photos and links to the videos:

> Tasers are not toys.&nbsp; The Guardian (UK) reports that Tasers were originally marketed as &#8220;non-lethal&#8221; devices, but based on the judgements of the SEC, this had to be amended to &#8220;less-lethal&#8221; devices:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,1583867,00.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://www.guardian.co.uk<wbr>/crime/article/0,2763,1583867</wbr><wbr>,00.html </wbr></a> &nbsp; 
  
> Accordingly they should be used with extreme discretion, much like a gun.&nbsp; 
> 
> But beyond these concerns over the real physical harm that tasers can inflict, I&#8217;m deeply disturbed by the unique psychological disfunction that is in play when this weapon is used.&nbsp; A good cop is trained to talk to people and to de-escalate thorny situations.&nbsp; But seeing the taser in use here reminds me of the way I&#8217;ve seen animal farmers use electric prods to herd pigs.&nbsp; 
> 
> Some cops obviously see the taser as an all too ready way to manipulate people without any vagaries like good communication or, heaven forbid, finesse.&nbsp; With the taser at hand, they see no need for explanations or restraint.&nbsp; And after reading over law enforcement officials responses to the above events, I realized that this is because the taser&#8217;s indiscriminate use, in evidence in the above two examples, is defended, even sanctioned.&nbsp; 
> 
> Without any question of the circumstances, officials fall back on the pat: tasers save lives.&nbsp; But some cops obviously see the taser as a license to sidestep simple human respect.&nbsp; There are limits, there are boundaries, there are rules &#8211; in place so that we are all safer &#8211; and the cops should be expected to respect them too. 
> 
> Here&#8217;s some suggestions about how to help fight police brutality from Human Rights Watch:
  
> <a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports98/police/what.htm" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://www.hrw.org/reports98<wbr>/police/what.htm</wbr></a> &#8211; though I think these suggestions are disappointing in that they focus on writing to someone else who is &#8220;in power&#8221; for help.&nbsp; That&#8217;s pretty weak.&nbsp; 
> 
> For that reason, I&#8217;ve attached the ACLU&#8217;s more practical &#8220;Know your rights&#8221; sheet.&nbsp; For more ACLU stuff check out: <a href="http://aclu.org/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://aclu.org</a> and  <a href="http://action.aclu.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AS_downloads" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">http://action.aclu.org/site<wbr>/PageServer?pagename=AS</wbr><wbr>_downloads</wbr></a>
