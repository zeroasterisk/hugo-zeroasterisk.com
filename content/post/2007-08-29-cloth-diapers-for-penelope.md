Thanks to Anita doing research (and generally being excited in all things baby&#8217;ish) we have a more solid conviction to cloth diapers.

And in case you haven&#8217;t heard or picked up on it&#8230; we have pretty much decided on the name &#8220;Penelope&#8221; after finding out that it was going to be a girl at yesterday&#8217;s ultrasound.

Yay!
