[Alan&#8217;s Google Profile][1], now updated with Buzz activity, searchable, and pulling content from various feeds, including flickr, facebook, twitter, etc&#8230;

If you don&#8217;t see this as &#8220;competition&#8221; for Facebook (et. al.) then you&#8217;re not seeing the same thing I am.

I personally love it, esp. the publicly searchable aspects and the integration  into the gmail interface but I might stop using it if other people don&#8217;t or if it can&#8217;t work two-way with facebook&#8230;.  (if I have to post in facebook for it to show up both places, guess what&#8230; I&#8217;ll just use facebook)
