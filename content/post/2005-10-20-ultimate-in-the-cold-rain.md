I played ultimate frisbee today, one of the last evening games of the year.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been getting dark earlier every week and now we have to stop playing around 7:15&hellip; when you start at 6:00 of after, that&rsquo;s really frustrating.

What might have been frustrating was that it was cold and rainy today, starting to be really ugly right about the time we started playing&hellip; but it wasn&rsquo;t frustrating at all.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Cold and rain apparently don&rsquo;t bother me at all when doing something I enjoy doing (and with the firm knowledge of a warm shower afterward).

**Now playing:** [Sea and Cake][1] &#8211;&nbsp;[seemingly][2]
