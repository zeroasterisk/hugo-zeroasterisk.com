Again, I&#8217;m amazed at the generosity of human beings.&nbsp; Perhaps silly, perhaps underused (no idea), and obviously narrow in scope&#8230; none the less, I&#8217;m still impressed that people have volunteered to make the following happen:

[Freedom Toaster][1]



> Freedom Toasters are conveniently located, self-contained,
> computer-based, &#8216;Bring &#8216;n Burn&#8217; facilities.
>
> Like vending machines,
> preloaded to dispense confectionery, Freedom Toasters are preloaded to
> dispense free digital products, including software, photography, music and literature.
>
> The Freedom Toaster project began as a means of overcoming the
> difficulty in obtaining Linux and Open Source software due to the
> restrictive telecommunications environment in South Africa, where the
> easy downloading of large pieces of software is just not possible for everyone.
