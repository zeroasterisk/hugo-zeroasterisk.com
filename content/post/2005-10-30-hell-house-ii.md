**Pre-Halloween Party : [Hell House II][1]**

Well, as with pretty much all [DJ Foursquare][2] (and hushabye house) parties, this was a great event. Chill people, great crowd, good venue (effective at least), great music, etc&#8230; It also benifited from a great collection of costumes and a very moderate and (sorry for this review) disney-land-like bondage show&#8230; Honestly, I don&#8217;t think the crew was disney-land&#8230; I&#8217;m sure they had to weak-i-fy their setup/show for the audience invovled. It&#8217;s cool, I didn&#8217;t get up there regardless&#8230; few people want to see me tied to a spinning cross (perhaps least of which, me).

Still, the party was great&#8230; If all such parties were like it, I would get out more.

I&#8217;ve posted a number of the [photos][3] from it (though several were &#8220;edited out&#8221;). If you have other photos of this event, let [me][4] know.
