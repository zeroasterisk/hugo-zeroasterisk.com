After several years of marriage and putting off having kids till we were more financially stable&#8230; we are now pregnant. Due in Jan. or Feb. 2008. We have no data, but &#8220;think&#8221; it&#8217;s going to be a girl&#8230;

Apparently, a few days ago, anita woke up from an amazingly realistic dream where she was holding &#8220;our baby girl&#8221;. We didn&#8217;t really think she was pregnant but after the dream, she had to take a pregnancy test and it turns out we are.

We didn&#8217;t tell people for a while&#8230; making sure it was for real. Several pregnancy tests later, we told family and friends and now I&#8217;m finally updating the sorry excuse for my blog.

Anita&#8217;s 4th year of school is entirely on-site rotations, and she&#8217;s getting accommodations in the schedule for the birth.
