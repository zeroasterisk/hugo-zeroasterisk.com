Anita has been going to school for her whole life. She&#8217;s 28, and she&#8217;s gone to school k-12, and then college for 9 years after that. She got her PharmD from OSU and became a Dr. of Pharmacy&#8230; but all of that is for naught without passing a national board and a state law board.

Well &#8211; she&#8217;s passed both on her first attempt and is now, a bonafide (licensed) Pharmacist.

One of those weights you didn&#8217;t know you were carrying was lifted from her shoulders when we found out.

She&#8217;s working at Target part time and we are all very proud of her and happy for her. Yay Anita.
