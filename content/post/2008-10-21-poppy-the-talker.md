Anita recently pointed out to me that Poppy has been talking to herself for weeks.&nbsp; I noticed it and never remarked on it because it seemed normal, but it is worth remarking on.

She will be crawling around, or cruising, or riding in a carrier or playing with a toy&#8230; often during a period or play or concentration, she will start babbling really quietly.&nbsp; A lot like talking to yourself, she just talks away while she&#8217;s working on whatever she&#8217;s working on.

Yesterday, Anita saw her playing with her kitchenette-toy and she was babbling&#8230; but there was something different about it.&nbsp; According to Anita, Poppy was acting and babbling like she was really playing pretend; putting things into and taking them out of various compartments in the toy, talking to them and the kitchenette and whatever else&#8230;. but all very quiet and under her breath.&nbsp; She&#8217;s not talking to us or for us to hear and congratulate her&#8230; she&#8217;s talking for her own purposes.
