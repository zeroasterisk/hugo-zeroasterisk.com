> During the campaign, the buzz-cut 27-year-old at the corner table helped write and edit some of the most memorable speeches of any recent presidential candidate. When Obama moves to the White House next month, Favreau will join his staff as the youngest person ever to be selected as chief speechwriter. He helps shape almost every word Obama says, yet the two men have formed a concert so harmonized that Favreau&#8217;s own voice disappears.
> 
> &#8220;He looks like he&#8217;s in college and everybody calls him Favs, so you&#8217;re like, &#8216;This guy can&#8217;t be for real, right?&#8217; &#8221; said Ben Rhodes, another Obama speechwriter. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t take long to realize that he&#8217;s totally synced up with Obama. . . . He has access to everything and everybody. There&#8217;s a lot weighing on his shoulders.&#8221;
> 
> Especially now, as Favreau and the rest of Obama&#8217;s young staffers begin a transition that extends far beyond new job titles. Three months ago, Favreau lived in a group house with six friends in Chicago, where he rarely shaved, never cooked and sometimes stayed up to play video games until early morning. Now, he has transformed into what one friend called a &#8220;Washington political force&#8221; &#8212; a minor celebrity with a down payment on a Dupont Circle condo

Inspiring to see someone so young accomplishing so much, through composition alone.
