Text of an email I spammed to just about everyone I have an address for:

> ===INTRO==============

> I&#8217;m sorry to have sent what could be considered propaganda to you. I believe it&#8217;s well put together and raises very important questions, furthermore validating those questions and invalidating many official responses with evidence. Because of this, and because it&#8217;s so easy to send around (just a link to a video) I have decided to send it to just about everyone in my address book. I&#8217;m sorry if you would prefer not to receive this email from me, but I still encourage you to try watching the video and listening to the arguments in it. (note: if you are on dial up, you might want to download it overnight and watch it the next day)

> ===EMAIL==============
>
> I suggest you watch this video, documenting some of the obvious inconsistencies with the official story of what happened on 911&#8230; it&#8217;s an hour and 20 minutes, and I think it&#8217;s brilliant.

> You can download it or stream it&#8230; and if you want me to, I can burn it to CD and send it to you&#8230;

> The video quality is good, considering, but there are times when it&#8217;s difficult to read text&#8230;

> And, of course &#8211; like all things&#8230; one can ask themselves significant questions about it&#8217;s facts and authenticity. but, if you take the most cynical view of this information and the most trusting view of the story we have been fed about the events of 911 and the actions of our government &#8211; you must still conclude that there are some impossible contradictions which can not be explained away, and some obvious invalidities in the official accounts&#8230; and that&#8217;s only if you dis-believe all data in this documentary and simply look the actual pictures and videos presented.
>
> It&#8217;s horrible information, and leads to horrible conclusions (or at least suspicions), but you MUST attempt to participate in your world. This is a part of it &#8211; a big part that will either make it to the future history books or be redacted from them&#8230;. Truth may be an impossibility, but we should demand some truth. We should not allow these lies&#8230;.

> Start fighting for actual freedom by spreading this information, by asking questions, and by demanding change.
