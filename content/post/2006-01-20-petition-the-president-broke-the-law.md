<MoveOn.org> petition: _The President Broke the Law_

> President Bush admitted to personally authorizing thousands of allegedly illegal wiretaps, and he doesn&#8217;t plan to stop. Circumventing the Constitution is serious business.
>
> This is a big moment. People from across the political spectrum are standing together to protect the rule of law and the principles that are core to our identity as Americans.
>
> Can you sign this petition to show Congress that Americans want a thorough investigation of the president&#8217;s secret wiretapping program?

I signed it and here is my extra comment:

We are walking ever closer to an Orwellian government, with &#8220;big brother&#8221; spying on all of us. One of the major foundations for our government was accountability for everyone, including the people in power&#8230; this is precisely what is needed to hedge against dictatorships and is precisely what is being ignored and over-ruled by Bush&#8217;s administration. We need some honest investigation. We need to hear the actual results of that investigation. If action should be taken afterwards, we need that action to be taken. A president isn&#8217;t abovethe laws of his country.
