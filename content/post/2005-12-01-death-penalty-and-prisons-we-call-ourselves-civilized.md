[**1000th &ldquo;Death Penalty&rdquo; murder since reinstating in 1976**][1]

Doesn&rsquo;t it seem strange to be killing people for killing people?&nbsp; I am aware that there are people that are dangerous enough to never let back into the population, but it seems hypocritical to kill them&hellip; Aside from the people who are significant dangers to our society, prisons should generally be cleared out a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

We are a nation built on and ruled by fear.&nbsp; That fear has driven us to quadruple (400%) our prisons and prisoners from 1980 to 2000.&nbsp; Violent crime has stayed about the same&hellip; (there was a decline every year under Clinton and a rise every year under Bush)&nbsp; We spend a lot of our money, making the prison construction workers rich, providing low paying and high-risk jobs to many, and encarcerating many many others&hellip;&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t tell, I&rsquo;m reading a book called &ldquo;[No More Prisons][2]&rdquo; by [William Upski Wimsatt][3] &ndash; I highly recommend it.

and on a lighter note&hellip;.

  * [FireFox 1.5][5]&nbsp;&ndash; is available&nbsp;&ndash; ([article][6], [followup article][7])
  * [Possibly really cool TV + Computer systems][8]
  * [video phones, not new, but maybe soon?][9]
  * [M$ security package&hellip; is that an oxymoron?][10]
