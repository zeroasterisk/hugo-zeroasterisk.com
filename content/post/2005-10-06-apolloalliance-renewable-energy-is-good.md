I recently found out about what appears to be a great group called [ApolloAlliance][1], which is setup in many states including [Ohio][2] and [Kentucky][3].&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a lot of good information there, including how to get invovled in local communities as well as how to become more energy efficient.&nbsp; (they&rsquo;ve even got job listings)

Since I&rsquo;m on the topic, I want to recommend anyone interested in energy conservationism (or conservationism in general) in the Louisville Kentucky area to check out the [BRKST wiki][4] (breakset resources and knowledge for sustainable thought) run by [Jason Smithson][5].&nbsp; Not only is there great general and local information up there, but as a wiki, you can add your own information and make it better for all. {[more info on wiki][6]}
