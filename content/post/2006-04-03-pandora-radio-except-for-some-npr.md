If you didn&#8217;t already know&#8230; [Pandora.com][1].&nbsp; Yes, that&#8217;s right.

What?&nbsp;&nbsp; You want to know what I&#8217;m talking about?&nbsp;

Simply, it&#8217;s a brilliant option for listen to music.&nbsp; You go to that site, create an ID (only requires an email address) and you get a personalized (personalizable) streaming radio station determined from a seed artist or song.

How does it know what music to select?&nbsp; It&#8217;s made by the people who did the [music gennome project][2], so they have littereally mapped and classified music (fairly well, it seems) and allow you to guide your station(s) accordingly&#8230; bring in variety or isolate to a single vein; the choice is yours&#8230;&nbsp;

I like that they have more music than I do (at least they have some music I don&#8217;t) and so I&#8217;m hearing stuff I like and know mixed with compatible music I don&#8217;t know.

It&#8217;s not perfect.&nbsp; I get some trash in my statin&#8230; I think I have gotten 2 or 3 &#8220;boy-band&#8221; type songs, but they are easy to dismiss (don&#8217;t have to listen to them) and they havn&#8217;t been coming back up.

so, yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s right.&nbsp; get on it.
