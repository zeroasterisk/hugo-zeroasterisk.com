[IHTFP Hack Gallery:Fire Truck on the Great Dome][1]:

A buddy of mine who went to MIT sent me this&#8230; He said the students have to dodge building security to get to the top of the dome&#8230; and the got the fire truck up there by disassembling it, carrying up the parts, and reassembling it on top.&nbsp;

Amazing!

A lot more effort than most people I know would put into something&#8230;
