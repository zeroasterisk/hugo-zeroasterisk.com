I&#8217;m in Louisville right now&#8230; there are a lot of people in the office for a flurry of meetings and it seemed appropriate for me to come as well.

Our biggest meeting started at noon today, and ends at 3pm tomorrow. We stopped for dinner at ~6pm and I came back into the office to work on some stuff&#8230; got stuck reading email and working on a side project.

Now I&#8217;m waiting on a bus to take me back to Theresa&#8217;s, where I&#8217;m staying&#8230;. \[tap\] \[tap\] [tap] waiting&#8230;
