Well we made it back to Lou. after going to a family reunion in Arkansas and then visiting family in Texas.[(photos)][1]

We&#8217;ve now rolled over 140,000 miles on our Honda CRV (1997) and it&#8217;s doing great. &nbsp;We are nothing but happy with that vehicle.

Anita&#8217;s doing well. &nbsp;She&#8217;s had some &#8220;symptoms&#8221; of pregnancy, but for the most part she&#8217;s avoided most of the typical complaints. &nbsp;She attributes the lack morning sickness to vitamine B6 and the lack of fatigue to being on vacation and napping all the time. &nbsp;

That&#8217;s about to change &#8211; Anita starts her first rotation Aug. 1st.

Work is going well for me, but I&#8217;m pretty busy. I started ultimate in Louisville again; seems like a good crowd to join up with: http://www.louisvilleultimate.org/ & http://groups.google.com/group/VilleCo-Ed (Cruella DeVille)
