[The Ultimate Sport &#8211; WSJ.com][1]:
  


> Besides being relatively inexpensive to play, part of Ultimate&#8217;s appeal lies in the fact that stature isn&#8217;t as critical as speed and dexterity: catching, throwing, jumping and pivoting. One of the star players for the Filipino team Pula, Panoy de los Santos, for instance, is just 1.57-meters tall (but the fastest member of the team). </p> 
> 
> Another attraction is that Ultimate is a noncontact game, so women like it as much as men do &#8212; 35% of the 500 players in the Philippines are female. As a result, Asian teams typically compete in the mixed divisions. 
> 
> Ultimate calls for players &#8212; seven to a side &#8212; to pass a plastic disc to each other within a 110-meter-long pitch and to score points by catching the disc in an end zone. The game has no referees; players resolve their own disputes and those who commit fouls are honor bound to admit them. At higher levels of play, there may be &#8220;observers,&#8221; but they make calls only when a team appeals. (Some Americans refer to the disc as a Frisbee, after a trademark brand.) 
> 
> In Singapore, the dominant Ultimate country in Asia after Japan, the game became popular in the late 1990s when some expatriates vowed to play once a week &#8220;rain or shine,&#8221; says Mr. DuBos. Then, students at the National University of Singapore and Singapore Management University took up the sport. Today, the city-state boasts eight club-level teams, which train together and compete in local and international competitions.
