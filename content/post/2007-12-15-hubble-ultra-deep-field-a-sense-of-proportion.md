As Douglas Adams put, humans really can&#8217;t deal with having a sense of proportion.&nbsp; We aren&#8217;t capable.&nbsp; But we can stretch for it&#8230; 

_(I can touch my toes, but I can&#8217;t bend further over&#8230; but I should try to)_

Take 5 minutes and read [this fantastic piece on an image from Hubble Ultra Deep Field][1].&nbsp; It&#8217;s a great reminder of what we know about space and a few tools to help you start to realize that you can&#8217;t ever come close to grasping a true sense of proportion.

In many ways, I find this liberating and beautiful.&nbsp; We are an infinitesimal part of something much, much bigger. Now, with pictures&#8230;

Even that number is still impossibly hard to comprehend &#8211; if you named a star every time your heart beat for your whole life, you&#8217;d have to live about 375 lifetimes to name your share.
