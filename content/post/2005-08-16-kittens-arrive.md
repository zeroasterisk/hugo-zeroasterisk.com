We have kittens.

That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s cute-fest-2005 in our apartment right now. We got a pair of <del datetime="2005-08-24T18:44:13+00:00">8</del> 6 week old kittens on Sunday from Anita&#8217;s co-worker who got them dumped on her by her mom. They are a brother (black) and sister (white & orange) and have very quickly bonded with Anita and I&#8230; they are ok with Nova, but she&#8217;s not yet ok with them. Nova actually submitted to them, belly up and looking away; our guard dog proving her grit once again. We are taking them in for shots and vet initiation tomorrow.

We have yet to come up with names for them. I would like to keep up the science theme of pet names (Quazar, Psi, Nova&#8230;) but nothing really effective has come up, yet. If you are quick and think of suggestions, let me know (comment, AIM, or email)&#8230; I&#8217;ll post the names when we determine them.

[Ultimate Summer League][2] is over.

I had a great time playing Ultimate on the summer league. It was good to be outside and to have a team of people have to work together&#8230; and to have people rely on me to make it, so I didn&#8217;t lazy-out of going just because it&#8217;s really hot. And MAN was it hot for the tournament this past Saturday. [<img src="https://zeroasterisk.com/photos/albums/Friends2005/Ultimate.thumb.jpg" alt="Ultimate - Todd and Jess on our team, in orange" align="left" />][3] We were outside from 8:00 am &#8211; 5:30 pm and it was sunny and HOT all day. I ended up mildly sun-burned but not as bad as I would have expected from such exposure. Our team played great, we won the first game and lost the second, but we lost to the #1 team and we gave them a really good fight. Then we sat around watching and heckling the other games for semi-finals and finals&#8230; for the finals game, people were silly &#8211; many people half drunk and a most of us were sun-weary&#8230; whenever play stopped frisbees were rolled from side to side of the field by spectaters aiming (poorly) for each other. There was a spirit award (given to one of the organizer&#8217;s team &#8212; &#8220;rigged&#8221;) and a party that night at some bar (I didn&#8217;t make it beacuse I was playing video games with Phil).

I&#8217;ll be able to play more frisbee at pickup games until it gets too cold&#8230; and then I might be able to find something&#8230;

Also, we are playing Capture the Flag this weekend. We&#8217;re playing around sundown on Sunday at someplace in Columbus. Want to play? Email me.
