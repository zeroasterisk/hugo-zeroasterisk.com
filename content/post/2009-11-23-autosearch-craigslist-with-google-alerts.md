Sometimes, I want something only if it&#8217;s on the cheap, second hand, and easy&#8230; that&#8217;s usually Craigslist.

Often what I want isn&#8217;t available when I think of it&#8230; but it might show up sometime&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to have to look at craigslist every day (because I wont).

[Google Alerts][1] to the rescue.

If I&#8217;m in Louisville KY and I&#8217;m looking for an iPod (for example) I just setup an alert for: &#8220;site:louisville.craigslist.org ipod&#8221;

Of course, that might be too many results and flood the inbox, but for the more obscure items, it&#8217;s a wonderful tactic and tool.
