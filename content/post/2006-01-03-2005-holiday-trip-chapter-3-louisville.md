Before we went to Houston, Anita and I spent some time in Louisville.

We were able to see some friends and a good amount of family. We missed out on the big family events, as we were in Houston then&#8230; but we still got to play some games and relax and eat and all the basic events of together-hood.

I worked in the Louisville office, but because most people weren&#8217;t there, I was able to get more work done than I usually do when I go into the office&#8230; but still less than I can get done at home&#8230; weird, huh?

New Year&#8217;s eve (Saturday), we went to the [Rudyard Kippling][1] and saw the [Lucky Pineapple][2], a band which I liked very much. They have a sound that I thought was a lot like &#8211; a less ambient, more local-rockish [Tortise][3]. Also at the show were a couple of other bands (also quite enjoyable) and many, many people I hadn&#8217;t seen in way too long. The figurehead of my estranged friends who were at the rud was Stacey, who I had not seen in multiple years. She&#8217;s living in Portland OR, after having lived in Chicago and traveled a bit&#8230; I&#8217;m very very happy to have seen her and all of the other friends whom I do not often get to see.

Sunday I had lunch with my father (a very good thing) we did another family event at Barb&#8217;s house (lots of fun for all involved). Then we drove to Columbus.

Today, we are mostly unpacked, and 24 hours into our [Master Cleanse][4]&#8230; a 10+ day flushing of the system in-taking only a lemonade concoction &#8212; updates as they happen.
