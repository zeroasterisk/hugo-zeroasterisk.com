[The World Can&rsquo;t Wait][1]&nbsp;&ndash; a site promoting active options for ridding ourselves of the current [blight][2] named [G. W. Bush][3].&nbsp;

    <tangent> Yes, I believe blight is an appropriate term&hellip; I mean seriously, how will our history books record this era in our country?&nbsp; The American people were duped, and when they realized it, they were ok with it&hellip;&nbsp; disappoing sounding eh? </tangent>

      <a href="http://todaysbushreason.blogspot.com/">Daily Reasons to drive out the Bush Regime</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Today&rsquo;s [Oct. 17] reason&nbsp;of the day comes from <a href="http://www.haroldpinter.org/home/index.shtml">Harold Pinter</a>, who recently won the Nobel Prize for literature. During a poetry reading in 2003, Pinter said: <em>&ldquo;The U.S. is really beyond reason now. It is beyond our imagining to know what they are going to do next and what they are prepared to do. There is only one comparison: Nazi Germany.&#8221;</em>

      <a href="http://worldcantwait.com/library/getdownload.php?id="3&download=1?"">WCW_Call</a> (<a href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:L3wYe0_FGpEJ:https://us.indymedia.org/us/servlet/OpenMir%3Fdo%3Dgetpdf%26id%3D9239%26forIE%3D.pdf+%22history+is+full+of+examples%22+%22right+on+their+side+fought+against+tremendous%22+as+pdf&hl=en&client=firefox-a">as html</a>) &ndash; &hellip;&ldquo;The point is this: history is full of examples where people who had right on their side fought against tremendous odds and were victorious. And it is also full of examples of people passively hoping to wait it out, only to get swallowed up by a horror beyond what they ever imagined.&rdquo;

    In fact &ndash; I got so motivated to help (in a small way), I made a <a href="https://zeroasterisk.com/wiki/FILES/a/a4/WorldCantWait.pdf">1 page flyer</a>, based on the 2 page Call (linked above).&nbsp; I will be surprised if something comes out of this, but I can be hopeful&hellip; the movements in the 60&rsquo;s had much more support and a general feeling of opportunity (or so it seems).&nbsp;

    Also, I see that Boots from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coup">the Coup</a> has made <a href="http://www.worldcantwait.org/media/airAmerica/bootsWCW.mp3">a commecial</a> for this group (<a href="http://worldcantwait.org/media/">as have other artists</a>). That makes me happy.
