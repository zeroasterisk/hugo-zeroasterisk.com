A quick note about [techno-passports][1] which are to be common soon (required I believe)&#8230; they put an antenna in the passport, to transmit data, and a material on the cover to stop the antenna from transmitting all time&#8230; strange? yes. this is of importance to people like [April][2] who are always (or at least often) using their passports&#8230; I bet it&#8217;s a few years yet before anita or I have to think about it. kinda neat though&#8230; it will be interesting to see how easily personal information is hacked out of a passport with an antenna.
