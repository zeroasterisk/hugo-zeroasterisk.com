Lots of us have to trace down odd bugs and test things on different browsers and OS combinations&#8230; Of course, the worst of which is &#8220;various versions of IE&#8221; on &#8220;various versions of Windows&#8221;. It seems crazy, but the same version of IE can behave differently on a different version of Windows.

The two best solutions I&#8217;ve used are:

http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools [free, vm locally]

and

http://www.browserstack.com/ [costs, web based]

I just got assigned a crappy bug ticket on IE8 + WinXP and had to dust this off again&#8230; thought I&#8217;d send out a post, see if it helps others and triggers a discussion which might help me out too.
