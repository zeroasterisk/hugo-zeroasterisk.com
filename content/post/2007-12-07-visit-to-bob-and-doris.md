Heading to the company meeting in Dallas, I was able to swing into Gainsville, TX for a couple of days to visit Bob And Doris (my Uncle and Aunt on my Dad&#8217;s side).

Doris is pretty much confined to a bed or wheelchair, but amazingly she seems to be in good spirits and would be her same old self if only her body would cooperate.

Bob is ok aside from a month long lung infection of some sort and continual problems with his coumadin.

Nothing much happened but thats totally fine with me.&nbsp; I read a lot of my book and got to say hi, in person.&nbsp; Wish I could do/say more.
