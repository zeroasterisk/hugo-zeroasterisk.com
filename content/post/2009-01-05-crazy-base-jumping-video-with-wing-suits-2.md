My mom and her friend Joanne painted a wonderful mural on Poppy&#8217;s room. I decided to play with a very fun tool called [photosynth][1] to stitch together several photos into one unified picture or the room in 3-D (sort of). It will not work except on IE and FF and you may need to install a viewer (it&#8217;s safe, but an annoyance). Regardless, this is my first photosynth and I may make more&#8230; not sure at the moment.



Or view it on the photosynth site at: [Poppy&#8217;s Room][2]
