So &#8211; Capture the Flag was a lot of fun. We played at the Park of Roses on [August 21 2005][1] (after sundown). We had 9 people show and had a great time, though we were out classed severely by some &#8220;in shape&#8221; players. I&#8217;m hoping to end up with more people in a bigger area for the [next game on September 9th (friday)][2] at an unknown location.

Google is incredible.

I&#8217;ve already installed the new Google Desktop (version 2, with the sidebar) and it&#8217;s HOT. I&#8217;m impressed that everything Google touches, they make better (at least as far as I can see)&#8230; If you&#8217;ve ever wanted easier access to stuff on your comptuer (email, etc) you should use the [GDS2][3] [(blog post)][4].

I am going to setup an account / access to Google Talk today. I have not used it, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s at least comparable with the other services out there&#8230; and because it&#8217;s Google, I bet it&#8217;s better. [(blog post)][5]
