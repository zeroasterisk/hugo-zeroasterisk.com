I&#8217;ve been very remiss at updating the blog here&#8230; I&#8217;ve had lots of good family time and some travels, some interesting stories and what-not.

but no&#8230; I&#8217;ve not been updating with anything important&#8230; and I&#8217;m apparently not going to start&#8230;&nbsp; Here&#8217;s a very minor update:

I&#8217;m getting on a greyhound bus today from Columbus to Louisville.&nbsp; Going to a few &#8220;in-the-office meetings&#8221; and also to help Karen and Bryan (Anita&#8217;s Mom & Stepfather) as they frantically get moved from their house in the suberbs to their Victorian house in Old Louisville.&nbsp; I think the people who bought it said they have to be out by Feb.&nbsp; Anita will drive to Louisville Thursday night (no classes nor work for her that Friday + weekend).
