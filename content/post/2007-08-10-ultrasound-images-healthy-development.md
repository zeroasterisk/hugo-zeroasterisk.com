Here are the ultrasounds from Anita&#8217;s Dr. visits. Poor quality images all, as they are on some kind of heat-transfer paper they don&#8217;t last, especially not in the heat. That said &#8211; they weren&#8217;t good quality images in the first place.

They are neat images though.amazing to see it grow from a bean to a vertebrate in a fairly short period of time. Fingers and toes&#8230; brain and legs. All looks healthy. (yay!)
