I was looking for an API for Google Analytics.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t find one, but I did find a slick little application for looking at the reports and stats of Google Analytics.

[Google Analytics Air][1]



> The Google Analytics Reporting suite is an Adobe AIR application that brings&nbsp;Google Analytics&nbsp;to the desktop. It uses itâ€™s own custom API to interact with Google and nearly implements all features of Analytics. See the feature list for more info.</p>
First, you need to download and install the Adobe AIR framework:

<small>NOTE: at the time of this post, you need to download and install the Beta2 release of AIR for the current release of the Google Analytics Reporting suite</small>

Then [download][2] and install the [gas2.air][3] air-application.

Slick.&nbsp; (good to setup for clients / noobs who want to watch their numbers)
