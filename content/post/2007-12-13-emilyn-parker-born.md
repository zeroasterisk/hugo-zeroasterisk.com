Anita and Alan and Cathy (Alan&#8217;s mom) visit Chris and Jenny Parker in the hospital ~2 days after the birth of Emmalynn Parker.

This was a &#8220;scary&#8221; birth story.&nbsp; After 7-8 hours of early/active labor, everything normal and in the Hospital&#8230; the baby monitor showed significantly decreasing heartrate.&nbsp; Chris hit the &#8220;call nurse&#8221; button about the same time as 4 nurses ran into the room and moved Jenny around.&nbsp; The changed position got the heartrate up some, but not enough&#8230; so an emergency cessarian was preformed.&nbsp; Apparently all went well &#8211; 10 fingers, 10 toes, healthy mom.&nbsp; 

It severed as a good reminder of why we want to be at the hospital for Anita and me.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been exposed to a lot of &#8220;hospital bad&#8221; stories from [Bradley classes][5]&#8230; nice to see why western medicine is useful.
