I think Ubuntu is great, easy to use, standardized, and built on Debian&#8230; what could be better? Apparently &#8211; there are certainly some things which could be better.

Here is [a great experiment one geek and his girlfriend undertook][1]:

With the latest release of Ubuntu,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br /> I was interested to see how far Linux had come since then in terms of<br /> being used easily by the mainstream. So, I tricked my grudging<br /> girlfriend Erin into sitting down at a brand new Ubuntu 8.04<br /> installation and performing some basic tasks. It’s surprising how many<br /> seemingly simple things become complicated and even out of reach for<br /> someone without a knowledge of Linux. There are a lot of little things<br /> that could be done to make the experience a lot more friendly for<br /> non-computer-literate people – some of them easy to implement, others<br /> not at all.</span>
