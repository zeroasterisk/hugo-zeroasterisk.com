so &#8211; there&#8217;s some buzz going on (yes, I&#8217;m a few days behind) about AOL and Yahoo letting companies pay (them) to send spam&#8230; but disallowing spam otherwise&#8230;&nbsp;

what?&nbsp;

If you could dis-allow it, do so.&nbsp; If your plan is put into effect, that means **more** spam in the inbox.&nbsp; It makes no sense.&nbsp; (links below)

  * [Yahoo and AOL Announce Pay Per Spam Email Project | Threadwatch.org][2]

There is discussion about what to do, to combat spam.&nbsp; More intelligent spam filters is a big first step&#8230;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baysian and more&#8230;&nbsp; I&#8217;m talking about filters ready to find &#8220;v 1 a ggrr aa&#8221; and mark that message as spam (unless that&#8217;s an email you would like to receive).&nbsp; Not that this will ever be 100%, but 90+% is pretty good.&nbsp; I get about 50-150 spam emails a day, but usually only see about 3-5.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t complain&#8230; i think that&#8217;s pretty good.

Here&#8217;s a tip to anyone on AOL mail (god forbid) or Yahoo mail&#8230;. go to [gmail][3].&nbsp; If gmail ends up charging or something&#8230; well &#8211; you&#8217;ll have to cross that bridge when it collapses, but for now it&#8217;s the best option I&#8217;ve seen (short of running your own mail server and a baysian filter).
