[<img src="https://zeroasterisk.com/photos/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=28823&#038;g2_serialNumber=2" style="float:right;" />][1]We have had our bed now for over an week and it is fantastic. I actually found myself sleeping propped up on my elbows one morning &#8211; and it was comfortable. We got a Sealy : [Reflexion : Venice Beach][2] &#8211; a big latext foam bed. We bought it at [us-matress.com][3], but we only had to buy the mattres (no box spring) so it ended up being a less than what you see as the cost. (still expensive, no doubt)

We ended up finding a used waterbed frame locally from [craigslist][4] for $40 , and we put the mattress on that. My mother has an old waterbed frame we would rather have, but it&#8217;s in Houston, TX and shipping was going to be upwards of $500.

So that&#8217;s the deal. Anyone want to try out the bed &#8211; it&#8217;s worthy of much praise and awe. Especially after we put on Anita&#8217;s new birthday present &#8211; an electric mattress pad.
