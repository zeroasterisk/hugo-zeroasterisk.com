Well, I&#8217;m finally done with updating the backlogged [Japan blog entries][1]. It was something I kept putting off, but I&#8217;m real glad I did it &#8211; the posts are kinda long, but it&#8217;s as much for my memory of the trip as anyone else&#8217;s (sorry).

[<img src="https://zeroasterisk.com/photos/albums/Friends2005/DSC01124.thumb.jpg" alt="Ryka" align="right" />][2] I&#8217;m impressed that within 45 minutes of uploading the lastest batch of photos, some of them have been looked at 4 times already&#8230; I know I&#8217;m just getting lucky, but it still nice to know someone is looking.

So, Wednesday night we went to Ryka&#8217;s (photo on right) birthday party at the Lodgebar in Columbus. It was so loud we basically couldn&#8217;t talk (but at least there is no smoking in Columbus bars). We stayed for about a half hour, like old fogies, but it was still good to see people&#8230; though communicating was nigh&#8217; impossible, as I&#8217;ve already said. Hopefully we will get to move on to other social activities like volleyball or [capture the flag][3].

Jaymz is coming to visit this weekend, which should be a lot of fun. Otherwise, no specific plans that I know of.
