                        <p>Hello everyone.&nbsp; We like to do things a bit latter&#8230;</p>

<p>you know, catch the after Christmas sales and have more time to</p>

<p>prepare.&nbsp; This year that philosophy also extends to Christmas cards and</p>

<p>in this case, emails.</p>

<p><strong>The year of 2007</strong></p>

<p>January of 2007 Alan&#8217;s team got outsourced to Singapore and he found a new job working for friends doing web development.&nbsp; Alan also picked up a contracting job which ended up being part-time which ended up being his new full time job this November.&nbsp; Anita stopped working (finally) and focused on keeping up with schoolwork and her sanity.&nbsp; Anita finished her last year of class-time with great grades and greater enthusiasm &#8211; &#8220;no more classes, no more books&#8230; no more teacher&#8217;s dirty looks..&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shortly after the end of the semester, Alan and Anita moved back to Louisville, KY.&nbsp; Alan kept the same job working for friends and started going in to the office&#8230; Anita took the summer off, a well earned break.&nbsp; They lived with Anita&#8217;s parents in a huge Victorian house in Old Louisville for a few months, and then started renting a friend&#8217;s house with Anita&#8217;s sister Virginia as a roommate.</p>

<p>Sometime in the early spring, Anita and Alan informed the world &#8211; with permanently affixed smiles &#8211; that their first child would be due around January 24th, 2008.&nbsp; After a few ultrasounds they found out that she was going to be a girl and after going through much Q&amp;A, they ended up on the name &#8220;Penelope Lou Blount&#8221; and hope to call her &#8220;Poppy&#8221; for short&#8230;&nbsp; Though to date, the following names have all been used: penny, pineapple, and lil&#8217; p.<br />
<a href="https://zeroasterisk.com/photos/v/ruby/2007_06_25.jpg.html" target="_blank"><img src="https://zeroasterisk.com/photos/d/61410-2/2007_06_25.jpg" height="115" width="150" /></a></p>

<p>During the summer, Alan&#8217;s family had a family reunion in beautiful Mountain View Arkansas.&nbsp; Everyone stayed in a set of cabins and went on hikes, shopping, museum&#8217;ing, canoe&#8217;ing, and caving (Alan, Anita, and Karen Wonderley decided to strap on headlamps and crawl).&nbsp; As always, there was lots of food, some games, and great &#8220;catch up&#8221; time.&nbsp; The family was able to organize a surprise, early baby-shower for Anita and Alan.&nbsp; It was a riot, and terribly sweet.<br />
<font size="1"><a href="https://zeroasterisk.com/index.php/2007/07/25/back-in-louisville-after-family-visitation/" target="_blank">/2007/07/25/back-in-louisville-after-family-visitation/</a></font><br />
<a href="https://zeroasterisk.com/photos/v/family0/2007/PenningtonReunion2007/IMG_0262.JPG.html" target="_blank"><img src="https://zeroasterisk.com/photos/d/30451-3/IMG_0262.JPG" alt="IMG_0262" longdesc="http://sue+and+pat's+preview+trip,+out+front+at+Pinewood." height="113" width="150" /></a></p>

<p>As mentioned above, Alan got a great job doing web development for a small-ish company who focus on audiology and speech therapy.&nbsp; Things seem to be going very well and it&#8217;s work-from-home again, which affords a lot of flexibility for Alan to travel around.&nbsp; Anita has been working month long rotations for her fourth and final year of school.&nbsp; It&#8217;s frustrating to pay full tuition and diligently work full time, but not get paid&#8230; only one year of that (less now) and Anita will be an official Doctor of Pharmacy.&nbsp; Until then, she&#8217;s learning about different branches of pharmacy she could go into and doing projects and presentations for her preceptors.</p>

<p>Early in December, Anita&#8217;s and her mom organized a baby shower for family.&nbsp; Alan&#8217;s mom was able to come up for the week and just under 20 people attended.&nbsp; It was filled with games and food and, of course, an amazing array of presents for Penelope and Anita.&nbsp; She was genuinely astonished and moved by the generosity of everyone.<br />

<p>And finally, the year ends with Christmas with Anita&#8217;s family. Because she is now 8+ months pregnant, traveling to Alan&#8217;s family was unfortunately, out-of-the-question.&nbsp; Staying in Louisville, there was still enough family to visit with 7 stops in two days and plans beforehand and afterwards.&nbsp; And that brings us to today&#8230;<br />

<p><strong>Our Plans for 2008</strong></p>

<p>Anita has pre-worked the month of February and has the month of January off.&nbsp; She&#8217;s keeping her fingers crossed about March.&nbsp; Everyone is quite excited about the birth (and life) of Penelope.&nbsp; Alan&#8217;s mom and stepfather will be joining the ranks at the hospital and then Cathy will be coming back to Louisville to help with Penelope for the month of March.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April and May of 2008, A.,A., &amp; P. will be staying in Houston, TX with Alan&#8217;s grandfather.&nbsp; Anita&#8217;s got a couple of rotations there and Alan can work from anywhere with a broadband connection.</p>

<p>Afterwards, A.,A., &amp; P. will be looking for a house to buy in Louisville, KY.&nbsp; Anita will start working on passing her licensure tests (one general test and a law test for every state she wants to practice in).</p>

<p><strong>And in closing</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a wonderful year&#8230; big stress on the word &#8220;full&#8221;. 3 jobs for Alan.&nbsp; Classes for Anita, followed by several one-month-jobs.&nbsp; Pregnancy with the first grandchild in both families.&nbsp; Two moves with a two-month-sabaticle and move on the schedule in 2008.&nbsp; A family reunion this summer and a few work conferences for Alan.&nbsp; All that, and no complaints.&nbsp; In fact, quite the opposite &#8211; many comments about how wonderful it is to have such a wonderful, entertaining, and supportive family and family of friends.&nbsp; Living the good life&#8230; still.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
Alan &amp; Anita &amp; Penelope</p>
