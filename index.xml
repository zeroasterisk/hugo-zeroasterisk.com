      <description>I have made the formal household declaration that all screen time will be matched, hour-for-hour with project time. Yesterday we cleaned the 1st floor, mopped and everything. Today we went grocery shopping, made lunch, and then started on homework time.
To say that I am unpopular here, would be an understatement.
But both of our kids will benefit from some extra assignements. Our education system is super lax, and a bit of supplimental assignment seems like a good idea.</description>

      <description>Best part of CodepaLOUsa so far&amp;#8230; sitting next to Douglas Crockford at dinner tonight. Occasionally I&amp;#8217;m the lucky one. (Hope I didn&amp;#8217;t bore him too much)
Anyway &amp;#8211; having a fun time at CodepaLOUsa and hope all other attendees are too.

      <title>Life Changlingly Good TED Radio Hour: “The Source of Creativity”</title>

      <description>http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/351538855/the-source-of-creativity
Basic summary: &amp;#8220;everyone is and can be creative: you just have to be fearless about failing, and practice a bunch.&amp;#8221;
Led to this understanding by my art-teacher mother, since early childhood I&amp;#8217;ve been saying something pretty similar.
Creativity is wonderful, amazing, useful, freeing, and fun&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s not rare. Being creative is a skill, available to everyone. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be &amp;#8220;Art&amp;#8221; (note the capital A) nor innovation. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be shared.</description>

      <title>Meteor 0.9.2-rc1 is fun to play with, Cordova support functional</title>

      <description>Last night I started playing with `meteor &amp;#8211;release 0.9.2-rc1` which you can read about and play with too; check it out here:
https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Cordova-Z5n6zkVB1xq
It&amp;#8217;s wonderful!
The local development and hot-code-push is a great improvement over any other solution I&amp;#8217;ve been using. Builds were painless (mostly).
Most of my stumbling points were due to 9x, not the new Cordova stuff.
A few interesting details&amp;#8230;
Cordova gets built here:

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve been watching this for a while, but now the first Alpha release is out for Meteor + Cordova built into the core.
SWEET!
Watch the DevShop Presentation on it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzNoXbv1DX4&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=24m
&amp;nbsp;
And here are instructions to get it going and play with it: https://meteor.hackpad.com/Getting-Started-With-Cordova-Z5n6zkVB1xq
&amp;nbsp;
Also, just an update, MeteorRider is still a strong and simple option for getting Meteor into Cordova (DOM hijacking), but I&amp;#8217;m also checking out another great looking option is Cordova Loader (builds all Cordova assets into the public folder of Meteor).</description>

      <title>Testing tools for Old OS &amp; Browser Combos</title>

      <description>Lots of us have to trace down odd bugs and test things on different browsers and OS combinations&amp;#8230; Of course, the worst of which is &amp;#8220;various versions of IE&amp;#8221; on &amp;#8220;various versions of Windows&amp;#8221;. It seems crazy, but the same version of IE can behave differently on a different version of Windows.
The two best solutions I&amp;#8217;ve used are:
http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools [free, vm locally]
and
http://www.browserstack.com/ [costs, web based]
I just got assigned a crappy bug ticket on IE8 + WinXP and had to dust this off again&amp;#8230; thought I&amp;#8217;d send out a post, see if it helps others and triggers a discussion which might help me out too.</description>

      <title>Great advice from Arunoda “Just Contribute!”</title>

      <description>http://readme.lk/noticed-tech-crowd-interview-arunoda-susiripala/
This advice might be aimed at people who already consider themselves developers, but there&amp;#8217;s a nugget in there that&amp;#8217;s perfect for anyone who is interested in getting started&amp;#8230;
Pick some open-source project, probably a smaller one, that does something you&amp;#8217;re interested in. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and used. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you tried out and it didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s something you looked at and didn&amp;#8217;t understand.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: see meteor-core-cordova-support-alpha-release-is-out (2014-08-25) for new information
&amp;nbsp;
About Meteor and PhoneGap / Cordova Meteor is a rapid server/client development framework, written in JS &amp;#8211; makes very interactive apps easy to build. http://meteor.com
PhoneGap / Cordova is a project to allow developers to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build mobile apps for all major devices. http://phonegap.com
Basics of Integrating Meteor + PhoneGap / Cordova The basic idea here is to use PhoneGap / Cordova to create a mobile App on several different platforms at once and it gives device hardware access; then “load” your Meteor application, which handles all of the rest of whatever you want your app to do.</description>

      <description>Everyone seems to do a great job of sending out yearly letters around the holidays, so here&amp;#8217;s our attempt.
We collected some of our favorite photos from this year (mostly just the summer and fall) and made this video:

Go ahead and watch it.
Back already?
It&amp;#8217;s the end of December already and Poppy is almost 4 (01/24) and Oliver is almost 2 (02/02). Last year at this time, we went to Kansas City for Christmas with Alan&amp;#8217;s family and after a long drive on Christmas eve, made it back to Louisville for Christmas with Anita&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <title>Adobe Connect Issue and Fix: Lingering FMSCore.exe processes</title>

      <guid>https://zeroasterisk.com/2010/07/23/adobe-connect-fmscore-process-killer/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve setup Connect to expire the FMSCore processes after 2 hours, but if someone is still connected to a recording, it will keep the old zombie FMSCore process until that person disconnects.
It often happens that doesn&amp;#8217;t work &amp;#8211; and there&amp;#8217;s seemingly no garbage collection in place to clean up old FMSCore.
So we created a simple AutoIt script which can be compiled to an EXE which works, but it has some dependancies&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Everyone and their mom have been using Git and GitHub for a while, but I&amp;#8217;m just breaking down and using it&amp;#8230; I have been slow to adopt because SVN worked for me fine (until I had to merge branches) and I don&amp;#8217;t like to pay for storage space. But I continue to be impressed by it&amp;#8217;s functionality and ease of use, so I&amp;#8217;m going to move our work repositories over (needing a Large account probably) but I think it will be worth it.</description>

      <description>Oliver has been feeling a bit sick for a couple of days, and it was acute yesterday early afternoon &amp;#8211; he was doing the &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m in pain&amp;#8221; cry for a half an hour straight and was inconsolable. Very unusual for him. So we made an appointment to see the Pediatrician and by the time we got in there (~3 hours later) he seemed pretty normal, though really tired still because he is sick and doing all the extra crying, but sleeping and eating ok again.</description>

      <title>CakePHP beforeSave() gotcha: need to set $this-&gt;__exists to true if setting a primary key</title>

      <description>I added an update to CakePHP Book: beforeSave()
 Also, if you add a primary key which would turn an &amp;#8220;insert&amp;#8221; into an &amp;#8220;update&amp;#8221; within beforeSave() you&amp;#8217;ll need to set $this-&amp;gt;__exists = true;&amp;#8230; the call to $this-&amp;gt;exists(); happens in model.php before the callback to beforeSave().
function beforeSave() { if (!isset($this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;]) &amp;&amp; isset($this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;unique_field&#39;])) { $found = $this-&amp;gt;find(&#34;first&#34;,array( &#34;recursive&#34; =&amp;gt; -1, &#34;fields&#34; =&amp;gt; array(&#34;id&#34;), &#34;conditions&#34; =&amp;gt; array(&#34;unique_field&#34; =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;unique_field&#39;]))); if (!empty($found) &amp;&amp; isset($found[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;])) { $this-&amp;gt;id = $this-&amp;gt;data[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;] = $found[$this-&amp;gt;name][&#39;id&#39;]; $this-&amp;gt;__exists = true; } } return parent::beforeSave(); }  That&amp;#8217;s been confusing me a bit recently &amp;#8211; setting the ID of a row within beforesave() should change the save to an update, but it was trying to insert with a specified ID and thus, failing&amp;#8230; glad to have a simple solution that makes sense&amp;#8230; hope that helps someone else&amp;#8230;</description>

If you don&amp;#8217;t see this as &amp;#8220;competition&amp;#8221; for Facebook (et. al.) then you&amp;#8217;re not seeing the same thing I am.
I personally love it, esp. the publicly searchable aspects and the integration into the gmail interface but I might stop using it if other people don&amp;#8217;t or if it can&amp;#8217;t work two-way with facebook&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>Most of you have heard from the grapevine or facebook (this generation&amp;#8217;s grapevine) that our son, Oliver Jackson Blount, was born on 2010-02-02 @ 14:35 EST. He was 9 pounds 15 ounces and 23 inches (they measured twice to be sure).
We had a home birth with 2 midwives and an apprentice, a doula, Anita&amp;#8217;s mom (former NICU nurse) and sister Virginia (new nurse) in attendance&amp;#8230; of yeah, and me. The decision to have a home birth was one we took very seriously and subsequently are very happy with; it being unusual is often the topic of conversation&amp;#8230; but I can summarize with the following: We had a normal and healthy fetus inside a normal and healthy mom, everything looking like it would progress as &amp;#8220;low risk&amp;#8221; we choose to stay at home with the support of professionals vs.</description>

      <description>http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/01/modern-browsers-for-modern-applications.html
 Many other companies have already stopped supporting older browsers like Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers. We’re also going to begin phasing out our support, starting with Google Docs and Google Sites.

      <title>MySQL Master/Slave Replication Monitoring PHP Script</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a bit proud of myself on this one&amp;#8230; I setup a simple, but clean and configurable, MySQL Master/Slave Replication Monitoring PHP Script:
http://code.google.com/p/php-mysql-master-slave-replication-monitor/ (docs)
It&amp;#8217;s Open Source and free, I welcome comments, suggestions, and questions.
I think this will be quite useful for anyone who is setting up a pair of MySQL servers as master/slave and want to be sure their replication works as it should.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working with CakePHP for a few years now and am very happy with it. I&amp;#8217;ve been working with the 1.2 version for a few months (since it went stable) and playing with the Auth and ACL core components.
I&amp;#8217;ve decided that ACL is too complicated for most setups, and Auth is fine, but not perfect. So after some research, I switched to the DarkAuth component, which was much better suited to my needs.</description>

      <title>A CakePHP gotcha for migrating from 1.1 to 1.2&#43; on Model-&gt;create()</title>

      <description>I reported this as a ticket, but as it turns out, it&amp;#8217;s a design choice.. but it&amp;#8217;s enough of a gotcha that I thought I should report it.
What happened The $this-&amp;gt;ModelName-&amp;gt;create() set the defaults for the next save, which is what I would expect. But on my database there&amp;#8217;s a default value set for the &amp;#8216;created&amp;#8217; field (the standard for datetime columns in PHPmyAdmin) as well as the &amp;#8216;modified&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;updated&amp;#8217; fields.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I want something only if it&amp;#8217;s on the cheap, second hand, and easy&amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s usually Craigslist.
Often what I want isn&amp;#8217;t available when I think of it&amp;#8230; but it might show up sometime&amp;#8230; I don&amp;#8217;t want to have to look at craigslist every day (because I wont).
Google Alerts to the rescue.
If I&amp;#8217;m in Louisville KY and I&amp;#8217;m looking for an iPod (for example) I just setup an alert for: &amp;#8220;site:louisville.</description>

      <description>So the website has been down from Oct 21st to Nov 23rd. The old server got hacked (or really, a sister-server) and due to security concerns, we didn&amp;#8217;t know what got owned and what was safe. We already had a different server hardware to put in place, just had to set it up. So we got that installed and up and running, but it took me a few more days to get around to implementing something on my site.</description>

      <description>We are home again, from a trip to San Francisco and Sonoma, California. (map)
The trip was for April&amp;#8217;s wedding (Anita&amp;#8217;s sister) to Billie one of our best friends from our three years in Columbus, OH.
We started out by going to Salt Point State Park and camping. We were able to hike to the beautiful (but cold) cliff-lined-coast and watch seals and waves alike. On our way back from camping we visited Fort Ross, the oldest establishment on the west coast, and old Russian trading post.</description>

      <description>Poppy&amp;#8217;s really thinned out and sped up. At 18 months, she&amp;#8217;s about the same height as she was at 14 months, but seems much more thin. Must be all the running, jumping, and climbing she does. She can happily run in a circle for 15 minutes, or bounce on a bed for 30.
She&amp;#8217;s started school at &amp;#8220;The Friend&amp;#8217;s School&amp;#8221; this week, in the 1 year old class three days a week for three hours each day.</description>

      <description>I recently came across wolframalpha which is really fantastic. It provides a much of data for a very wide variety of searches&amp;#8230; basically the neat part is it&amp;#8217;s conversion of English statements into data-based queries and graphs&amp;#8230; It works across tons and tons of datatypes, including one of the most useful weather reports I&amp;#8217;ve seen&amp;#8230; simple and obvious and useful data across the board. (perhaps I just like graphs too much) It also has good financial data, though I still prefer google finance.</description>

      <description>Poppy is now using her potty.
She&amp;#8217;s been sitting on it for a while, but this weekend was the first time she actually used it successfully (twice so far). We, of course, cheered and encouraged her&amp;#8230; But I think it just clicked in her brain that was what she was supposed to do. I don&amp;#8217;t expect that we&amp;#8217;re going to have a terribly high success rate right away, but it&amp;#8217;s great to be on that path.</description>

      <description>Poppy has stopped walking and is pretty much either running to places, or stumble-running. I&amp;#8217;m sure that&amp;#8217;s an exaggeration, but it is certainly what it seems like.
Likewise, she&amp;#8217;s still babbling incoherently &amp;#8211; but she&amp;#8217;s doing so loudly. Also &amp;#8211; her speech patterns are much closer to English. We don&amp;#8217;t know what she&amp;#8217;s saying, but she sure does and, by god, she means it. Her actual vocabulary has increased to maybe a dozen words and phrases:</description>

      <description>Poppy is starting to really put things together. She&amp;#8217;s long been understanding much more than we would have expected, occasionally doing things we ask her to do which we would never anticipate her doing (like asking her to throw something away in another room, and her doing so). Now she&amp;#8217;s starting to say a few more words, do a few more signs, and saying/signing more clearly.
She&amp;#8217;s had a bit of a rough month, all four of her I-Teeth are coming in.</description>

   She&amp;#8217;s certainly got an attitude and is already testing boundaries and figuring out what she can get away with. More so right now, as her i-teeth are coming in, all four at once.</description>

      <description>Little poppy is fast and furious these days (at least when she doesn&amp;#8217;t get what she wants, fast enough). Turn your back and she&amp;#8217;s gone&amp;#8230;. or perhaps she&amp;#8217;s up, as in climbing up furniture. She&amp;#8217;s eating a lot (sauteed mushrooms and onions and swash and garlic, last night&amp;#8230; mmmm) and still has chubby legs and a belly on her, but for the most part has lengthened out and looks more and more like a kid and less and less like a baby.</description>

      <description>Poppy has long been termed as a &amp;#8220;rough neck&amp;#8221; and she certainly earns that title, loving to be thrown around and tickled and rough housing with her peers or adults alike.
She has just started spinning around in circles to get herself dizzy. It&amp;#8217;s one of the cutest things I&amp;#8217;ve ever witnessed.
The downside is that she already staggers like a drunk anytime she&amp;#8217;s tired and sometimes when she&amp;#8217;s not&amp;#8230; so this just adds to the appearance that she is seconds away from being face-down on the ground.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;#8217;ve just fought a battle w/ SVN merge and thought I&amp;#8217;d post the solution in case others might find it&amp;#8230;
Scenario
Our stable code is in trunk svn://svn.domain.tld/repository/trunk
I&amp;#8217;ve got a branch of trunk svn://svn.domain.tld/repository/branches/dev
Changes have been made to my branch and changes have been made to trunk, since I branched.
I&amp;#8217;m ready to merge my branch back into trunk.
Approach / Overview
Basically, to be safe, I need to first update my branch with the changes from trunk and resolve any conflicts.</description>

We all had a wonderful visit and they played with poppy almost nonstop&amp;#8230; as expected. We took full advantage of the free babysitting and went out a few nights and on the whole, were less than adequate hosts, but they didn&amp;#8217;t seem to mind.

      <description>Poppy is:
 walking well, though she still staggers like she&amp;#8217;s drunk when she&amp;#8217;s tired. sometimes eating vegetables, often not &amp;#8211; but always eating fruit and crackers are much better starting to learn a few signs&amp;#8230; she&amp;#8217;s known &amp;#8220;more&amp;#8221; for a while now, but now she can do eat and drink and occasionally a few others. certainly understands many words and phrases and tones of voice, and is starting to mimic more often&amp;#8230; sometimes putting a word in context a bit&amp;#8230; though it&amp;#8217;s a stretch and only her family would recognize these accomplishments.</description>

It was crazy to see all of the trees weighed down and drooping, beautiful and terrible. The ice coated everything, and when the wind blew all of the ice-coated limbs and branched clinked with each other.

 How are these ruthless, careless ghouls who murdered the economy still walking around (not to mention that sociopathic sadist Bernie Madoff?) — and not as perps?
Bring on the shackles. Let the show trials begin.
 Very frustrating indeed, but I don&amp;#8217;t know of any means of invoking a change. We can complain on the net and raise virtual pitchforks in anger&amp;#8230; but there&amp;#8217;s nothing which will come of it.</description>

She had her cake and ate it too.&amp;nbsp; Anita expected that she might not take to the cake straight away, but she certainly dug in, as soon as she realized that it was food and she was allowed to eat it.</description>

Letter subject: &amp;#8220;Memo to All My Valued Employees&amp;#8221;
Basic gist of the letter:
 Most of my time is now occupied with government mandates and regulations and all the accounting that goes with them. On October 15th, I wrote a check to the US Treasury for $288,000 for quarterly taxes. You know what my “stimulus” check was?</description>

      <description>Penelope is really talking these days. There are still no really discernable words, and for the most part, no reliable mimicking. We can not prompt her and expect a desired response. But she is certainly mimicking speech patterns on her own including intonation and cadence. She&amp;#8217;ll do so while toddling around the house carrying a toy or article of clothing or piece of trash. She will also babble back to you, when you&amp;#8217;re talking to her.</description>

      <description>Scott and Tami had a wonderful wedding in Columbus in late fall 2008. We went with Poppy and my mom Cathy. At the wedding they had a photobooth set up and some of the photos went into a scrapbook and some we took home&amp;#8230; here are the took home ones.</description>

      <description>My mom and her friend Joanne painted a wonderful mural on Poppy&amp;#8217;s room. I decided to play with a very fun tool called photosynth to stitch together several photos into one unified picture or the room in 3-D (sort of). It will not work except on IE and FF and you may need to install a viewer (it&amp;#8217;s safe, but an annoyance). Regardless, this is my first photosynth and I may make more&amp;#8230; not sure at the moment.</description>

      <description>This is an absolutely crazy base-jumping video, with wing suits. If I didn&amp;#8217;t have the life and family I have now, I could see myself wanting to do this, but there&amp;#8217;s too much risk involved for me and I&amp;#8217;ve got too much to loose. Still &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s awesome to see.

      <description>We went to Houston this year, for Poppy&amp;#8217;s first Christmas and spent almost a week with my family.&amp;nbsp; Everyone loved and was amazed by Poppy, of course and she did splendidly.&amp;nbsp; She traveled quite well, sleeping for the first part of both flights and playing quietly for the second.&amp;nbsp; She also did a remarkably good job dealing with all the people she didn&amp;#8217;t really know and the back and forth craziness of going from house to house to house.</description>

      <description>Helping to Write History
By Eli Saslow
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, December 18, 2008; Page A01
 During the campaign, the buzz-cut 27-year-old at the corner table helped write and edit some of the most memorable speeches of any recent presidential candidate. When Obama moves to the White House next month, Favreau will join his staff as the youngest person ever to be selected as chief speechwriter. He helps shape almost every word Obama says, yet the two men have formed a concert so harmonized that Favreau&amp;#8217;s own voice disappears.</description>

      <description>We have refinanced (or at least started the process) and locked in at 4.96 after paying a point (it was 5.6 without the point, lenders wanting up-front money and assurance in today&amp;#8217;s market). We are rolling in the point and closing costs into the new loan and we&amp;#8217;ll still be saving $140/month over our current loan (and if we hadn&amp;#8217;t rolled in the costs, it would only have saved us $21/month more).</description>

 PHP would be Cafeteria Christianity &amp;#8211; Fights with Java for the web market. It draws a few concepts from C and Java, but only those that it really likes. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s not as coherent as other languages, but at least it leaves you with much more freedom and ostensibly keeps the core idea of the whole thing.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a great video done by Dan Harris of ABC news on the Mates of State and what the family does when they go on tour.
I love the wholesomeness of it and it fits right in with what I think they would be like.&amp;nbsp; This band is one of my absolute favorites and that&amp;#8217;s only encouraged by this peak into their good parenting and family priorities.

      <description>So there&amp;#8217;s no going back&amp;#8230; Though she&amp;#8217;s still holding on to fingers when offered (or when produced after her sometimes insistent request) she is walking all the way across rooms without assistance and often without falling.&amp;nbsp; For the most part, when she does fall, it&amp;#8217;s fairly controlled and without incident.
All of our childproofing is being reassessed now.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a best effort thing anyway &amp;#8211; for the most part, she&amp;#8217;s going to get into whatever she can, we just try to remove the most dangerous and delicate things from 4 feet or lower.</description>

      <description>An excellent article on Walmart being evil or not &amp;#8211; a fairly objective seeming overview of the major points of discussion for the different camps on Walmart.
 That&amp;#8217;s a good thing, right? If a company achieves its lower prices by finding better and smarter ways of doing things, then yes, everybody wins. But if it cuts costs by cutting pay and benefits&amp;#8211;or by sending production to China&amp;#8211;then not everybody wins.</description>

      <description>I thought this was a very interesting article
Birth Control Pills Affect Women&amp;#8217;s Taste in Men
 It’s all about scent. Hidden in a man’s smell are clues about his major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which play an important role in immune system surveillance. Studies suggest that females prefer the scent of males whose MHC genes differ from their own, a preference that has probably evolved because it helps offspring survive: couples with different MHC genes are less likely to be related to each other than couples with similar genes are, and their children are born with more varied MHC profiles and thus more robust immune systems.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m one of the first to speak out against the current (soon-to-change-thank-god) US government, but this video really does make me sad. I have little to say positive toward G.W.Bush and have certainly complained about him (often) when really complaining about the actions of many many people&amp;#8230; but I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d go so far as to refuse to shake his hand. I mean, he&amp;#8217;s still a person.
On the otherhand, I myself have toyed with the idea of considering him a mass murderer&amp;#8230; so from that perspective, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to shake his hand or be in the same room with him.</description>

      <description>One sunny day in 2009 an old man approached the White House
from across Pennsylvania Avenue, where he&amp;#8217;d been sitting on a
park bench. He spoke to the U.S. Marine standing guard and
said, &amp;#8216;I would like to go in and meet with President Bush.&amp;#8217;
The Marine looked at the man and said, &amp;#8216;Sir, Mr. Bush is no longer
president and no longer resides here.&amp;#8217;
The old man said, &amp;#8216;Okay, thank you&amp;#8217; and walked away.</description>

We watched the results at our friend&amp;#8217;s house and were ready to cry together, but thankfully we didn&amp;#8217;t have to.&amp;nbsp; After the last two presidential elections, I was pessimistic and ready to be disappointed &amp;#8211; when Obama won I really had to do a couple of reality checks.</description>

      <description>An email from my Mom who recently visited us. It&amp;#8217;s a great recap and update on Poppy, so I&amp;#8217;m just pasting in here:
 I recommend becoming a grandmother &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s the best! I have just returned from a week in Louisville with Alan and Anita&amp;#8230;and Poppy, which included two Halloween parties, a wedding in Columbus, a long walk in Iroquois park to check out the fall colors, two swimming lessons for Poppy (with Anita), and progress made on Poppy&amp;#8217;s room mural by my good friend, Joan Firster and me.</description>

      <description>We went for Poppy&amp;#8217;s nine month old check up today and she is starting to slim down and lengthen. At her 7month visit, she was 19lbs and 27.5inches, and now she is holding steady at 19lbs and up to 29inches. There were no vaccines today &amp;#8211; woohoo!
After her visit and a good nap, we were playing downstairs and she took her first preliminary, wobbly steps. It was just 2-3 steps a time or 2, but it was pretty amazing.</description>

      <description>Anita recently pointed out to me that Poppy has been talking to herself for weeks.&amp;nbsp; I noticed it and never remarked on it because it seemed normal, but it is worth remarking on.
She will be crawling around, or cruising, or riding in a carrier or playing with a toy&amp;#8230; often during a period or play or concentration, she will start babbling really quietly.&amp;nbsp; A lot like talking to yourself, she just talks away while she&amp;#8217;s working on whatever she&amp;#8217;s working on.</description>

This is the error I was getting:
 bash: /sbin/tuncfg: No such file or directory</description>

      <description>NY Times article:
Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending : September 30, 1999
 In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.
The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets &amp;#8212; including the New York metropolitan region &amp;#8212; will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans.</description>

      <description>Poppy has started really reaching for people when she wants to be held.&amp;nbsp; She also now will usually kiss whomever is holding her.&amp;nbsp; That kiss is often with an open mouth and extended tounge, but we&amp;#8217;re not picky &amp;#8211; it counts!
 You can tell she wants to stand all the time.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s pulling up on stuff and getting her balance and letting go with both hands, usually to fall in a second or on a good day, two&amp;#8230; but she keeps her balance well sitting and fairly well standing.</description>

Most people in this country are now aware that we are on the brink of a depression as serious as the one in the 1930s.&amp;nbsp; People are up in arms, talking to their congressional representatives and it is all over the media.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;#8217;s action (or at least attempted and perhaps misguided action) in our government to fix some of the problems, and we are all sure the sky is falling and things need to be done.</description>

      <description>Anita and many of the mom&amp;#8217;s took their offspring to Tyler Park today.
Poppy was somewhat fussy, all day and in fact all month&amp;#8230; she&amp;#8217;s getting teeth and she&amp;#8217;s frustrated that she can&amp;#8217;t really walk on her own yet.&amp;nbsp; Life is hard.
So hard, in fact, that sometimes, if you&amp;#8217;re a baby, you just gotta eat some leaves and puke&amp;#8230; which she did, with abandon.&amp;nbsp; What we didn&amp;#8217;t figure out until ~9pm tonight was that one of those leaves was stuck to the roof of her mouth for over 5 hours.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m Voting Republican is a satirical look at the likely outcome of another four years of Republican government.

On Sunday afternoon the wind really started picking up. We thought a storm was coming, but we had no idea about the extent. So, stupidly, we went for a walk around the neighborhood with Poppy. As we are walking, we see a small tree go down&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;whoa &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s crazy&amp;#8221; but you know, it&amp;#8217;s a small tree, perhaps it was just planted&amp;#8230; then we get a little further and we hear a big ripping sound and look back and less than half a block up a huge oak tree has just been pulled up at the roots.</description>

      <description>Poppy is over seven months old now. 223 days. She&amp;#8217;s old.
In her first week of being 6 months old, she started getting her first tooth and started crawling. She quickly realized that through crawling is reliable, it&amp;#8217;s not as great as pulling up to standing and trying to coax someone or anything into keeping her upright while she staggers towards any object of her desire. Basically, we spend a lot of time with her holding onto our fingers as we stoop over and walk her around&amp;#8230; she sits when she&amp;#8217;s near something she wants.</description>

      <description>A recent report from Don Jackson at SecureWorks (dated March 20 2007) examines a new Trojan and provides some alarming insights on Internet Identity Theft. It is worth reviewing this case carefully to understand how sophisticated modern identity theft schemes have become, and how difficult it can be to investigate and prevent them.What makes this Trojan interesting is that it:
 is installed automatically simply by visiting an infected web site is invisible to the user is often missed by anti-virus software is able to steal identity information even if it is encrypted using https efficiently collects large amounts of information and sends it to a “mother ship” provides an interface for fraudsters to easily purchase the stolen data is been used to collect thousands of login credentials at major banks and government agencies has not been shut down is only one of many such programs that are now offered as kits  source: http://www.</description>

      <description>Poppy is a feirce 6 months now. She is sitting and crawling and talking a lot (though still mostly in vowels only).
What&amp;#8217;s funny is to see her grab ahold of something (anything) and shake it.
&amp;#8220;What does this do? How about if I beat it against the floor for 5 minutes? hmmm&amp;#8230; What about after another 5 minutes?&amp;#8221;
She is so much fun to watch and interact with&amp;#8230; all she&amp;#8217;s doing is sitting or crawling and violently shaking/beating/eating whatever is in her little hands&amp;#8230; but that&amp;#8217;s more than enough to keep us watching.</description>

We&amp;#8217;ve been finishing up packing and moving into our new house!
As such &amp;#8211; things are of course &amp;#8211; crazy and i&amp;#8217;m beaten down (in fact, I
might have very very mild heat stroke) &amp;#8211; but we&amp;#8217;re both really happy to
be here and get this house&amp;#8230; we&amp;#8217;ll be getting things setup as we can</description>

      <description>Most changes are gradual &amp;#8211; including this one&amp;#8230; Poppy is sitting up pretty well now. Over the last two weeks she&amp;#8217;s been getting closet to sitting unaided and most of this week, as long as there&amp;#8217;s a pillow to protect her from occasionally flailing backwards &amp;#8211; she&amp;#8217;s a solid sitter. Amazing how proud I can be over such simple accomplishments.</description>

      <description>We have made an offer on 183 Coral Ave. and it was accepted (finally).
You may have heard about the problems we had with the last house we were interested in, so were were trying not to get our hopes up too much &amp;#8211; but now we are signed and contracted&amp;#8230; good to go.
The house is big enough with a little expansion room in the basement, across the street from a great park and on an almost double lot.</description>

      <description>Alan&amp;#8217;s fingers were bent backwards and the ligaments are contracting/scaring&amp;#8230; this is supposed to fix it (uncomfortably).

 Spring-Coil Finger Extension Splint (“Capener” or Wynn Perry)  
Coil springs are placed laterally to the PIP joint and move in line with the joint to increase extension.  </description>

      <description>Our daughter is 5 months old today. The milestones of time help me take account of the monumental changes which have happened. We have a fully fledged baby &amp;#8211; nobody would call her an infant&amp;#8230; she will never be an infant again.
This is both wonderful and tragic &amp;#8211; but luckily more on the wonderful side.
She&amp;#8217;s starting to teeth occasionally, but it seems to bother her for a couple of days here and there.</description>

      <description>We had gotten VERY excited about a house we were going to buy.
We made an offer, they countered, we accepted&amp;#8230; all today (Sunday). We were waiting on the counter-offer-paperwork to sign and send back&amp;#8230; well, instead of getting that, we actually got notified that the offer was retracted. Someone else made a better offer and we weren&amp;#8217;t given an option to bid back.
Of course, this was after we&amp;#8217;d told everyone and after we&amp;#8217;d gotten really, really excited about this house.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been putting off upgrading to FF3 because I was afraid of plugins which wouldn&amp;#8217;t work and at this point, I live by many of my FF addons.
Well I feel silly now &amp;#8211; having updated&amp;#8230; Things seem to be as smooth as possible and FF is much more responsive. YAY MOZILLA!</description>

      <description>Poppy at Month four:
This month has been quite productive. She has been growing by leaps and bounds, like
normal. She&amp;#8217;s now reaching for everything and
putting it all in her mouth and dropping it on the floor. Nothing is safe within a foot and a half of her. She is sitting up well, if you help her
out. She&amp;#8217;s standing well, if you help her out. I think she is just</description>

      <description>we had a date last night (our first in 6+ months) and ate Ethiopian food and watched &amp;#8220;Iron Man&amp;#8220;. Both the food and the movie were fantastic!
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because we haven&amp;#8217;t really had a night to ourselves in a while; maybe it&amp;#8217;s because we haven&amp;#8217;t seen a movie in a few months&amp;#8230; but we both loved every second of our date and I personally will be re watching iron man a few times.</description>

      <description>I think Ubuntu is great, easy to use, standardized, and built on Debian&amp;#8230; what could be better? Apparently &amp;#8211; there are certainly some things which could be better.
Here is a great experiment one geek and his girlfriend undertook:

      <description>Just an FYI &amp;#8211; some of our old sites are not filtering out injection
attacks and got hosed last weekend. The attack seems fairly
sophisticated (imo) and is described in this post.

      <description>Poppy went swimming for the first time in her cute little two piece + diaper. Mom and Grannie C and Papa all helped keep her afloat. She did great, not always sure she knew what was going on, but was happy and absorbed the new experience without drinking too much chlorinated water. All told, she was probably in the water for almost an hour.</description>

      <description>Update &amp;#8211; we are in Houston for April and May. Staying w/ family and
Anita&amp;#8217;s doing her last rotation at a hospital here. They are kicking
her ass and not even saying sorry&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s the home stretch till
she&amp;#8217;s finally done with school forever! (YAY)
Poppy is big-tastic. She is holding her head up all the time,
laughing a little (when tickled or otherwise super-excited) and smiling
a lot. She&amp;#8217;s almost on a schedule &amp;#8211; which includes 15-30 min of crying</description>

      <description>Penelope has laughed in her sleep and has done some sort-of laughs along the way, but last night, for the first time, she laughed.&amp;nbsp; We got several giggles from her.&amp;nbsp; We were tickling her and of course giggling ourselves, but regardless &amp;#8211; she laughed.&amp;nbsp; We were beside ourselves, as would be expected.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s starting to make some syllable sounds, but it&amp;#8217;s not very far along as of yet.</description>

      <description>The drive to Houston went wonderfully. We did have to stop several
times, but it was just less than what we had prepared for. An 8.5 hour
leg of the trip took 11 hours.
We got to stop in KC and see Karen, Aunt Sue, and Uncle Richard. We
stayed for breakfast and then drove to Gainsville and visited my uncle
Bob. That 7 hour drive took about 10. After staying the night with</description>

      <description>This Jan. we thought it would be a good time to start looking for houses, since the rates came down&amp;#8230; but being slow and you know, having a child &amp;#8211; we just recently got out and actually looked at houses.
By now the rates are over 6% for a standard 30yr mortgage. We have perfect credit and decent everything else&amp;#8230; but the lenders are just not passing along the reduced rates.</description>

      <title>Prescription drugs in drinking water</title>

      <description>A vast array of pharmaceuticals &amp;#8212; including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones &amp;#8212; have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans, an Associated Press investigation shows
To be sure, the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals are tiny, measured in quantities of parts per billion or trillion, far below the levels of a medical dose. Also, utilities insist their water is safe.
But the presence of so many prescription drugs &amp;#8212; and over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen &amp;#8212; in so much of our drinking water is heightening worries among scientists of long-term consequences to human health.</description>

      <description>Uploaded photos of Poppy for the last several weeks (havn&amp;#8217;t uploaded since early Feb.). You can go through the new ones (march and feb) or just look at the main stream of photos.
It snowed around 7 inches on Friday and Saturday, and we got to play in the snow some, but only very briefly. We both started to daydream about taking Poppy out for sledding adventures and hot chocolate afterwards.</description>

      <description>I arrived at the Louisville, KY airport at 5:30am, Feb 29 and tried to check in for my flight #1755 to Dallas, TX. As it turns out, the confirmation/look up number I received with my itinerary was invalid. They couldn&amp;#8217;t find it. And then, upon further investigation, the ticket had been refunded or somehow mis-scheduled. I had to get back in line (I&amp;#8217;d been holding up the line this whole time and by now, it was long).</description>

      <description>Breast milk contains stem cells &amp;#8211; Monday, 11 February 2008 &amp;#8211; By Catherine Madden
 The Perth scientist who made the world-first discovery that human breast milk contains stem cells is confident that within five years scientists will be harvesting them to research treatment for conditions as far-reaching as spinal injuries, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease.
But what Dr Mark Cregan is excited about right now is the promise that his discovery could be the start of many more exciting revelations about the potency of breast milk.</description>

So, I know I spend X% on food and Y% on rent&amp;#8230;
I&amp;#8217;ve been nothing but impressed.
There&amp;#8217;s also a &amp;#8220;how to save money&amp;#8221; section which strikes me as advertising and I&amp;#8217;ve dutifully ignored it.</description>

      <description>Ok &amp;#8211; yeah, she&amp;#8217;s only 15 days old today&amp;#8230; sounds like nothing&amp;#8230; but she is already changing.&amp;nbsp; Her head is getting more solid and her face seems to be solidifying (for want of a better term).
Poppy is getting big.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s still under 10 lbs, but she&amp;#8217;s moving more, making want-to-be-crawling motions when on her belly&amp;#8230; and is more prone to recognize people around her.
She&amp;#8217;s starting to be unhappy when she realizes people aren&amp;#8217;t holding her or at least around her&amp;#8230; but that might not be new &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s just new that people aren&amp;#8217;t always holding her.</description>

      <description>Poppy is doing great &amp;#8211; an absolute joy to have around 95% of the time.&amp;nbsp; She can get fussy sometimes, but it&amp;#8217;s not bad at all &amp;#8211; and she&amp;#8217;s so happy most of the time.
We&amp;#8217;ve gotten better at giving baths and getting dressed and diapering.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;ve using about 50%/50% cloth and disposable diapers.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;#8217;d like to use more cloth, but they really don&amp;#8217;t fit her yet, they are too big.</description>

      <description>My life has shifted. If my perspective on the world were comprised of tectonic plates &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s as if a new continent has formed, replete with earthquakes, tsunamis, and the readjustment of every other piece of the former world. That analogy is poor, because in my case, all these changes are great. Great is an understatement; magnificent is an understatement.
So &amp;#8211; here&amp;#8217;s the short story for those who haven&amp;#8217;t heard it yet.</description>

      <description>Baby Watch Update: 2008.01.23 @ 4pm
Anita&amp;#8217;s been having some serious contraction for a while&amp;#8230; it could be early labor or it could be pre-labor. Even if this isn&amp;#8217;t it, we have an appointment tomorrow morning for induction since Penelope is probably pretty big, and Anita is not (relatively speaking).
So &amp;#8211; tonight or tomorrow.
We&amp;#8217;re at home now and likely to remain here until we&amp;#8217;re convinced she&amp;#8217;s in labor (contractions ~5 min apart for an hour, with a change in activity in between)&amp;#8230; or until tomorrow morning at 9am.</description>

B-day has been great&amp;#8230; a walk in the woods w/ Myra, followed by fantastic sushi lunch and great coffee&amp;#8230; then to work (at work now)&amp;#8230;
The only real complaint I have is that Penelope isn&amp;#8217;t here yet.</description>

Apparently, Gena is into Disney Princess stuff&amp;#8230; Anita was able to come to the rescue and provide the appropriate frilly dress and paraphernalia. A fun visit &amp;#8211; to be sure&amp;#8230;
   
Note the really neat images of Simon watching his train &amp;amp; Gena running across the room in light-up shoes (slow shutter speed == action shot == cool)</description>

Google Analytics Air
 The Google Analytics Reporting suite is an Adobe AIR application that brings&amp;nbsp;Google Analytics&amp;nbsp;to the desktop. It uses it’s own custom API to interact with Google and nearly implements all features of Analytics. See the feature list for more info.</description>

A picture&amp;#8217;s worth 1000 words&amp;#8230; and I&amp;#8217;m wouldn&amp;#8217;t write that much anyway, but here are some pictures to prove my point:

      <description>Hello everyone.&amp;nbsp; We like to do things a bit latter&amp;#8230;
you know, catch the after Christmas sales and have more time to
prepare.&amp;nbsp; This year that philosophy also extends to Christmas cards and
in this case, emails.
The year of 2007
January of 2007 Alan&amp;#8217;s team got outsourced to Singapore and he found a new job working for friends doing web development.&amp;nbsp; Alan also picked up a contracting job which ended up being part-time which ended up being his new full time job this November.</description>

      <description>http://lynncoins.com/lunar.htm&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; looking at the basic calendar, Anita&amp;#8217;s a monkey, Alan&amp;#8217;s a goat and Poppie will be&amp;nbsp;a rat.
  http://lynncoins.com/chinese_newyear.htm&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211;
however this link informs that the chinese new year really begins on a different date every year based on a lunar calendar. &amp;nbsp;As such: Anita is really a
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;ldquo;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep%28zodiac%29&amp;rdquo;&amp;gt;goat/sheep (earth sheep), Alan is really a horse (earth horse), and Poppie will be a pig (fire pig).
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; The Pig type is usually an honest, straightforward and patient&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; person.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s long, but great &amp;#8211; go read the Nerd Handbook and understand your favorite nerds just a bit more. &amp;nbsp;Here&amp;#8217;s a quote from the top:
 Understand your nerd’s relation to the computer. It’s clichéd, but a nerd is defined by his computer, and you need to understand why.
First, a majority of the folks on the planet either have no idea how
a computer works or they look at it and think “it’s magic”.</description>

      <description>I recently came up with a VERY simple algebraic equation&amp;#8230; trying to figure out how many months it would take for something to become cost effective.&amp;nbsp; I looked at the equation and thought I would see if google search could solve it (it can solve basic math problems and even unit conversions), but google couldn&amp;#8217;t handle it.&amp;nbsp; So I thought I&amp;#8217;d see if there was something else.&amp;nbsp; It took no time to find Algebrahelp.</description>

      <description>As Douglas Adams put, humans really can&amp;#8217;t deal with having a sense of proportion.&amp;nbsp; We aren&amp;#8217;t capable.&amp;nbsp; But we can stretch for it&amp;#8230;
(I can touch my toes, but I can&amp;#8217;t bend further over&amp;#8230; but I should try to)
Take 5 minutes and read this fantastic piece on an image from Hubble Ultra Deep Field.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s a great reminder of what we know about space and a few tools to help you start to realize that you can&amp;#8217;t ever come close to grasping a true sense of proportion.</description>

      <description>Not that it matters to most of you, but a friend of mine reminded me that I should indicate who I am voting for&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; If for nothing else I like the following line:
 I offer trustworthy, competent and genuine leadership. I am not a Politician.
 Of course, anyone can say that &amp;#8211; but my general feeling is that he would be a good Senator.

      <description>Anita and Alan and Cathy (Alan&amp;#8217;s mom) visit Chris and Jenny Parker in the hospital ~2 days after the birth of Emmalynn Parker.
  more&amp;#8230;
This was a &amp;#8220;scary&amp;#8221; birth story.&amp;nbsp; After 7-8 hours of early/active labor, everything normal and in the Hospital&amp;#8230; the baby monitor showed significantly decreasing heartrate.&amp;nbsp; Chris hit the &amp;#8220;call nurse&amp;#8221; button about the same time as 4 nurses ran into the room and moved Jenny around.</description>

      <description>Heading to the company meeting in Dallas, I was able to swing into Gainsville, TX for a couple of days to visit Bob And Doris (my Uncle and Aunt on my Dad&amp;#8217;s side).
Doris is pretty much confined to a bed or wheelchair, but amazingly she seems to be in good spirits and would be her same old self if only her body would cooperate.
Bob is ok aside from a month long lung infection of some sort and continual problems with his coumadin.</description>

      <description>Everyone seems to be gearing up for the baby-shower.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;m sure its going to be rife with &amp;#8220;ooohh&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;awww&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;isn&amp;#8217;t that
cute&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp; Typically I&amp;#8217;m pretty easygoing about such things, but in this
case, I&amp;#8217;m glad it&amp;#8217;s a woman-only-affair.&amp;nbsp;
That said, Anita is surprising herself with how into the whole affair she is becoming.&amp;nbsp; Those hormones are potent, it seems.
To all friends who were not invited&amp;#8230; guess what&amp;#8230; no friends were.</description>

      <description>Here are some fun pictures of Anita and Penelope. She&amp;#8217;s now 7 months pregnant and starting to get a bit un-comfortably pregnant. Parts of her fall asleep without reasonable cause. Getting up is more of a challenge than it&amp;#8217;s ever been before. Penelope is kicking most of the time, sometime flipping around and keeping things interesting&amp;#8230; occasionally kicking down &amp;#8211; apparently very painful, that.</description>

The color leaves a bit to be desired, but the subject matter afforded an opportunity to play with manual focus on the camera from a close distance&amp;#8230; also it&amp;#8217;s neat to see something like this, zoomed in.

      <description>This is about the best news ever.&amp;nbsp; (my stomach thinks so)
We just heard about this today, and went to Maido&amp;#8217;s (in Louisville, KY &amp;#8211; map)&amp;#8230;. it was absolutely fantastic!
For less than $9, you get to pick over some of the best Japanese food in Louisville.&amp;nbsp; As of now, it&amp;#8217;s only been open for lunch for about a week and there were few people there.&amp;nbsp; So go quick.
I suspect when word of this gets out, it will either stop or get ridiculously busy.</description>

Anyway&amp;#8230;
Anita&amp;#8217;s very pregnant&amp;#8230; always holding her belly and still, gloriously asymptomatic.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;#8217;s working at a low cost mdeical center pharmacy for this month&amp;#8217;s rotation.&amp;nbsp; not very interesting for her.</description>

      <title>“the Iraq war is largely about oil” — Alan Greenspan</title>

      <description>Sadly for Bush and Cheney, Greenspan decided to put prudence aside in his new book, The Age of Turbulence, and answer the most neuralgic issue of our times – why the United States invaded Iraq.
Greenspan writes:
&amp;#8220;I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil.&amp;#8221;
Everyone knows? Would that it were so. But it’s hardly everyone. Sometimes I think it’s hardly anyone.</description>

Perhaps if I watched television more, or talked to strangers more&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; perhaps if I got out of my daily life and tried to make a change in the world which reflected my beliefs (such as they are)&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; perhaps if I didn&amp;#8217;t live so comfortably I&amp;#8217;d work to fix what seems obviously wrong with the world.</description>

      <description>This is an excellent article, discussing the specific misunderstandings and mistakes made by the US government in response to the 911 attack on the WTC and Pentagon.
 &amp;#8220;Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward … and freedom will be defended.&amp;#8221; In other words, George W. Bush thought that the reason the United States was attacked was that the attackers hated our freedom. How did he reach this conclusion?</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re tired of propaganda; tired of conspiracy theorists telling you that your media is mostly brainwashing you into the party line of big brother&amp;#8230; &amp;nbsp;
Wake up.
There is a lot of conspiracy theory which must be wrong. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#8217;s nuts&amp;#8230; so you choose not to belive it. &amp;nbsp;You don&amp;#8217;t accept things at face value. &amp;nbsp;You look for evidence to refute crazy stories.
Good.
Do so. &amp;nbsp;But do so, also, to the &amp;#8220;official story&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Great article on Bush&amp;#8217;s current strength and resolve to bring war to Iran and again devastate a sovereign nation.
 Hearken to the astonishing rhetoric Bush used at the American Legion Convention in Las Vegas against Tehran:
&amp;#8220;Iran &amp;#8230; is the world&amp;#8217;s leading state sponsor of terrorism. &amp;#8230; Iran funds terrorist groups like Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which murder the innocent and target Israel. &amp;#8230; Iran is sending arms to the Taliban.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Anita doing research (and generally being excited in all things baby&amp;#8217;ish) we have a more solid conviction to cloth diapers.

 &amp;#8211; good article on pros and cons http://www.greenmountaindiapers.com/newmom.htm &amp;#8211; good pictures and helpful info on how to use and chose which type  And in case you haven&amp;#8217;t heard or picked up on it&amp;#8230; we have pretty much decided on the name &amp;#8220;Penelope&amp;#8221; after finding out that it was going to be a girl at yesterday&amp;#8217;s ultrasound.</description>

 And now I wondered if that son ever cried for the man who raised him and watched him grow up? I’d be curious as to how Karl Rove would ever explain his pierced, gay father? He never told the people in Louis’ phone book that he had died, nor invited them to a service if there was one. No one even knows where he is buried.</description>

      <description>Here are the ultrasounds from Anita&amp;#8217;s Dr. visits. Poor quality images all, as they are on some kind of heat-transfer paper they don&amp;#8217;t last, especially not in the heat. That said &amp;#8211; they weren&amp;#8217;t good quality images in the first place.
   
They are neat images though.amazing to see it grow from a bean to a vertebrate in a fairly short period of time. Fingers and toes&amp;#8230; brain and legs.</description>

We&amp;#8217;ve now rolled over 140,000 miles on our Honda CRV (1997) and it&amp;#8217;s doing great. &amp;nbsp;We are nothing but happy with that vehicle.
Anita&amp;#8217;s doing well. &amp;nbsp;She&amp;#8217;s had some &amp;#8220;symptoms&amp;#8221; of pregnancy, but for the most part she&amp;#8217;s avoided most of the typical complaints. &amp;nbsp;She attributes the lack morning sickness to vitamine B6 and the lack of fatigue to being on vacation and napping all the time.</description>

Anyone who works with/develops AJAX and a dynamic web-user-interface&amp;#8230; especially if you already use prototype&amp;#8230; I highly recommend you try this set of tools.

Apparently, a few days ago, anita woke up from an amazingly realistic dream where she was holding &amp;#8220;our baby girl&amp;#8221;. We didn&amp;#8217;t really think she was pregnant but after the dream, she had to take a pregnancy test and it turns out we are.</description>

      <description>Petition to save Internet Radio: http://capwiz.com/saveinternetr
 I&amp;#8217;ve been reading up on copyright laws in America and internationally and it seems blatantly obvious that the extra costs and constraints put on internet radio are one symptom of a larger problem&amp;#8230; that our copyright system is outmoded by the technologies of the past 20 years. That&amp;#8217;s a larger problem for another day {read &amp;#8220;Free Culture&amp;#8221; for more information}.For now&amp;#8230; lets look at Internet Radio.</description>

      <description>So, due to a degraded HDD in my RAID5 array, I decided to build a new array.
I bought 4 320G Seagate drives&amp;#8230; those drives have many benifits, not least of which, a 5 year warranty.
I already have a 3ware escalade RAID controller (7506-4LP), one of the best options for a hardware RAID controller.
Instead of building another RAID5, I chose to build 2, RAID1 arrays. I chose this because it&amp;#8217;s much easier to buy 2 hard drives (upgrading one mirrored pair) than to buy 4 hard drives (to upgrade a 4 disk array).</description>

After a bit of debugging, I figured out that the failing variable was in the &amp;#8220;check architecture&amp;#8221; section of the script&amp;#8230; In my case, I simply stripped out the logic and put in the following text to just set variables to my specific setup:

      <description>As you can see below &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s cold and wet&amp;#8230; It hasn&amp;#8217;t stopped snowing or sleeting in about 24 hours.
Anita&amp;#8217;s birthday was great. I drove her to get coffee and then to school. I picked up lunch and delivered it. School actually got cancelled early today (unheard of here). We hung out and watched Battlestar Gallactica for a while and then went to eat at the Surly Girl with some good friends.</description>

      <description>I am now hired on a 2 month contract with via studio, a very well respected design/development/consulting company. This may turn into a long term position, but the 2 month contract period is a good trial run for them and for me. I&amp;#8217;ll update as I have more information.
Today is my last day of work at Mercer. It has ended lack-luster (painfully), but the whole experience has been great for me.</description>

      <description>As one might so commonly read on IT employee blogs, &amp;#8220;our team has been laid off&amp;#8221;.
That&amp;#8217;s right, the whole team is being outsourced to Singapore, effective Jan 31.
It will be a near-future disaster for the company, though it might encourage the abandonment of many applications and proceedures which I&amp;#8217;ve been complaining about for years. But though on paper it looks like money saved, I suspect it will end up as more costly to keep things working/improving or a less expensive disaster where nothing works.</description>

      <description>My past 3 weeks&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;ve worked ~210 hours&amp;#8230; that averages to 70 hours per week&amp;#8230; but really I worked almost 100 hours in one 7 day period.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; One day, i worked from 6am &amp;#8211; 2am, and one day I worked from 9am &amp;#8211; 2am.&amp;nbsp; Always getting up and working the next day by 9am at the latest and working more than a full day&amp;#8230; every day.
Why would I do such horrendous work?</description>

      <description>A great but disturbing email sent by my friend Jason E. (spoon):
 November 14th, 2006: A student is tasered five times while in police custody while in the library at UCLA. The cops tase him, not because he&amp;#8217;s fighting them, but because he is (non-violently) refusing to walk out of the library with them.&amp;nbsp; Note that the cop says, &amp;#8220;Stand up or you&amp;#8217;ll get tased again.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;
Of anything on this video that comment really sickens me the most.</description>

      <description>The Ultimate Sport &amp;#8211; WSJ.com:
 Besides being relatively inexpensive to play, part of Ultimate&amp;#8217;s appeal lies in the fact that stature isn&amp;#8217;t as critical as speed and dexterity: catching, throwing, jumping and pivoting. One of the star players for the Filipino team Pula, Panoy de los Santos, for instance, is just 1.57-meters tall (but the fastest member of the team). Another attraction is that Ultimate is a noncontact game, so women like it as much as men do &amp;#8212; 35% of the 500 players in the Philippines are female.</description>

Imagine the following (hypothetical) savings account earning 1% annual interest. 1% annual is (0.01 / 365) 0.000027397260274 daily interest. So for every day, you multiply the amount of money you have accruing interest by that daily amount&amp;#8230; add the days together and you&amp;#8217;ve got your interest amount for that length of days&amp;#8230; when your money amount changes (when you add to it or reduce it) your calculations change, so you need to reflect that&amp;#8230; a basic table is displayed below&amp;#8230;</description>

I have come home after a bad day several times this quarter, and he has cleaned. We&amp;#8217;re not talking just dishes &amp;#8211; we&amp;#8217;re talkin dishes, sweeping, mopping, cat box, laundry, the whole nine yards. He does these things even though he&amp;#8217;s been working all day and probably hasn&amp;#8217;t had a much better day than I have.</description>

This is the 3rd wedding rind on Anita&amp;#8217;s finger&amp;#8230; all 3 from Alan, and all within the first 5-6 years of marriage. Luckily all three of them together are less than many people pay for one&amp;#8230; this weighing in fairly high on the price list at ~$170&amp;#8230; we purchased it from Donald R. Pekarek, the jeweler/goldsmith/artist who made it. He was at a local art fair a couple of weeks ago, here in Columbus and though we were not really in the market, decided that it seemed very Anita&amp;#8217;ish and she wanted to have a ring again&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>Iddybud: The Buck Stops with Bush:
 What we have done in Iraq &amp;#8211; the way we went about this venture &amp;#8211; is something I&amp;#8217;m sure that President Bush now regrets, even though he&amp;#8217;d never admit it. We have a strategic nightmare on our hands, and we also have citizens of Iraq &amp;#8211; not al Qaeda, but citizens &amp;#8211; murdering one another. The children in the photo you see above are real.</description>

      <description>Inside Toyota&amp;#8217;s hybrid factory | CNET News.com:
 TOYOTA CITY, Japan&amp;#8211;While you&amp;#8217;re touring the assembly area in Toyota&amp;#8217;s Tsutsumi auto plant, your mind keeps telling you that you&amp;#8217;ve been here before. Then it hits you.
It&amp;#8217;s a lot like the Snow White ride at Disneyland. Robotic cars filled up with wiper blades and other parts amble along a track in the floor, taking parts from the procurement department to other ends of the factory.</description>

This video/song is fantastic&amp;#8230; it hits pretty close to home for me and several of my friends, though. Personally it&amp;#8217;s hitting at least 40% acurate for me:
I&amp;#8217;m fluent in Javascript, do webpages for friends, got a friend who went to MIT, have stationary rims, i&amp;#8217;ve got a soldering gun, i edit wikipedia, i can quote the whole &amp;#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&amp;#8221;, and I wanna bowl with the gansta&amp;#8217;s.</description>

his second song was &amp;#8220;I do what I have to do to make me feel like a man&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; which is a great song.&amp;nbsp; during it, watching him, I realized that I too, am a man&amp;#8230;
sounds stupid, I know. I&amp;#8217;ve been married for 6 years and have a real job and real responsibilities and nothing has changed in my life much for the last couple of years&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>While suturing a cut on the hand of a 75-year-old Texas rancher, whose hand was caught in a gate while working cattle, the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man. Eventually, the topic got around to former Texas Governor George W. Bush and his elevation to the White House.
The old Texan said, &amp;#8220;Well, ya know, Bush is a &amp;#8216;post turtle&amp;#8217;.&amp;#8221; Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a &amp;#8216;post turtle&amp;#8217; was.</description>

      <description>CNN.com &amp;#8211; GOP split as Senate panel bucks Bush on terror tribunals &amp;#8211; Sep 15, 2006:
 The bill was backed by Republican Sens. John Warner of Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
It differs from the administration&amp;#8217;s proposal in two major ways: It would permit terror suspects to view classified evidence against them and does not include a proposal that critics say reinterprets a Geneva Conventions rule that prohibits cruel and inhuman treatment of detainees.</description>

      <description>Engineered cells beat cancer in human test | Chicago Tribune:
 In a small study of patients with terminal skin cancer, Maryland scientists have demonstrated for the first time that genetically engineered immune cells can kill off large tumors.
The research, conducted by a team at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, remains highly experimental, and it worked on just two of the 17 patients in the study.
But excited government scientists said it is the first time gene therapy has vanquished an advanced cancer.</description>

      <description>Five years after 9&amp;frasl;11, the Bush administration has failed to keep us safe. In fact, we are less safe.
The war in Iraq has diverted attention from protecting America from terrorism. In fact, this past week 9&amp;frasl;11 commissioners said Iraq is distracting from security at home.
The war in Iraq has inflamed the whole Middle East and is helping Al Qaeda attract new recruits. Osama Bin Laden is still on the loose.</description>

Though we&amp;#8217;ve been sitting on (or making more) weapons and not really attacking with them (just testing them)&amp;#8230; they exist to be used and can be within minutes from right now.</description>

Indian-born scientist developing coated DVD&amp;#8217;s that can make hard disks obsolete
..: I find my self thinking that hard drives wouldn&amp;#8217;t be obsolete, but OS installations might be.&amp;nbsp; Already there are many LiveCD installations of Linux and Windows, which don&amp;#8217;t require a Hard Drive at all, but simply boot to the CD/DVD&amp;#8230; With more sophisitication and personalization options (there are already setups where you can store personalizations on a USB flash drive or something) I think the idea of a static state OS would be very appealing.</description>

he came up in conversation again today and so I found his site again and found this page (among others) which just makes me go all warm and fuzzy:</description>

      <description>Was the 2004 Election Stolen?
Republicans prevented more than 350,000 voters in Ohio from casting ballots or having their votes counted &amp;#8212; enough to have put John Kerry in the White House. BY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.
This is a great article, full of well cited and reasoned points&amp;#8230; pointing towards a conclusion which may well get you branded as a conspiracy theorist&amp;#8230; but still seems the most likely explanation.</description>

      <description>According to the article: Transcendental meditation good for stress: study it goes a bit further than just getting relaxed&amp;#8230;
 Practicing transcendental medicine not only mellows the mind but may also calm the body&amp;#8217;s damaging responses to stress that leads to heart disease and diabetes, researchers said on Monday.
&amp;#8230;
Meditation has been previously shown to lower blood pressure, but researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, found it also decreased heart rate variability and insulin sensitivity.</description>

      <description>Friday, Anita and I went to Bardstown, Ky to go &amp;#8220;Moonlight Kyaking&amp;#8221; with Theresa and some of her Rugby Teammates/friends [link].
Before we got there we swung by the Jim Beam plant (thinking it was where Myra did a bunch of cool carpentry work, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t) and then the Bernheim Forrest. Bernheim has always been a great place to get back to nature a bit, but it&amp;#8217;s gotten a lot nicer&amp;#8230; the visitor&amp;#8217;s center is amazing, and all the displays and trails we saw, were flawless.</description>

      <description>I have put off writing something in response to my visit to Houston, Tx. Partially due to laziness, and perhaps partially to allow more time for settling of experience&amp;#8230; mostly laziness, I suspect.
I was there from May 10th &amp;#8211; 17th, 2006.
About half of the reason I went was simply to have a vacation. It was a chaotic time at work for the prior 2 months and after working many 70 hour weeks in a row&amp;#8230; it was time to do something else.</description>

      <description>Text of an email I spammed to just about everyone I have an address for:
 ===INTRO==============
I&amp;#8217;m sorry to have sent what could be considered propaganda to you. I believe it&amp;#8217;s well put together and raises very important questions, furthermore validating those questions and invalidating many official responses with evidence. Because of this, and because it&amp;#8217;s so easy to send around (just a link to a video) I have decided to send it to just about everyone in my address book.</description>

      <description>If you didn&amp;#8217;t already know&amp;#8230; Pandora.com.&amp;nbsp; Yes, that&amp;#8217;s right.
What?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You want to know what I&amp;#8217;m talking about?&amp;nbsp;
Simply, it&amp;#8217;s a brilliant option for listen to music.&amp;nbsp; You go to that site, create an ID (only requires an email address) and you get a personalized (personalizable) streaming radio station determined from a seed artist or song.
How does it know what music to select?&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#8217;s made by the people who did the music gennome project, so they have littereally mapped and classified music (fairly well, it seems) and allow you to guide your station(s) accordingly&amp;#8230; bring in variety or isolate to a single vein; the choice is yours&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;</description>

The top image is a map where the top NY Times stories are plotted&amp;#8230; but below that is a thought-map, of sorts&amp;#8230; a link-chart of buzzwords.
kinda neat&amp;#8230; to see that almost everything links to &amp;#8220;violence&amp;#8221; and that the &amp;#8220;united church of christ&amp;#8221; links only to &amp;#8220;churches&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;television&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;advertising&amp;#8221;.

      <description>I have setup a Flickr account/profile and played with it some&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; it&amp;#8217;s totally awesome.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;ve heard of it for years, but haven&amp;#8217;t needed anything like it, since I have gallery installed on a server on which I have nigh&amp;#8217;-unlimited storage space&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;
Anyway &amp;#8211; that&amp;#8217;s my excuse for being slow to jump on this bandwagon&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#8217;m here now.
The only question is deciding if I want to make the switch and pay for an unlimited account&amp;#8230; then move all the photos I have in gallery into flickr&amp;#8230; and worry about when their server goes down or looses all of my photos (not that such is likely, but less under my control).</description>

      <description>I just got done watching the movie: Lord of War (2005)
I think it was a good film, in the vane of &amp;#8220;blow&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;traffic&amp;#8221; but with a different angle and a semi-moral overtone.&amp;nbsp; The best part, IMO, is the ending and the open and blatant fact that when it comes to weapons of any sort, the US not only has the most, but sells the most &amp;#8211; seemingly to anyone else.</description>

      <description>I just got done reading : The Brutal Christ of the Armageddonites &amp;#8211; by Jon Basil Utley
It&amp;#8217;s a great overview of / perspective on the Christian &amp;#8220;pro-end-of-the-world&amp;#8221; movement which has begun (in this country) to not only become fairly popular, but to be largely represented in the government and the financial elite.&amp;nbsp;
This is, no doubt frightening&amp;#8230; but again, it brings me back to one of my major complaints about most organized religion&amp;#8230; arrogance.</description>

what?&amp;nbsp;
If you could dis-allow it, do so.&amp;nbsp; If your plan is put into effect, that means more spam in the inbox.&amp;nbsp; It makes no sense.&amp;nbsp; (links below)

 Achtung! You are 23% brainwashworthy, 18% antitolerant, and 28% blindly patriotic
Congratulations! You are not susceptible to brainwashing, your values and cares extend beyond the borders of your own country, and your Blind Patriotism does not reach unhealthy levels. If you had been German in the 30s, you would&amp;#8217;ve left the country. One bad scenario &amp;#8212; as I hypothetically project you back in time &amp;#8212; is that you just wouldn&amp;#8217;t have cared one way or the other about Nazism.</description>

A mohawk is a wonderful thing for several reasons.&amp;nbsp; Some of them are:
 I have hair on the top of my head still, might as well enjoy it. It improves my ultimate frisbee game (seriously). It reminds me and anyone else that I&amp;#8217;m not really all the way old, yet. It helps instantly filter people, like John&amp;#8217;s pants, for any who know.</description>

      <description>I was recently sent a link to the article Explosive Testimony: Revelations about the Twin Towers in the 9&amp;frasl;11 Oral Histories, on the site 911truth.org. I think the article, though kind of long, deserves a read. I wasn&amp;#8217;t there but i agree that something happened&amp;#8230;. it is almost unbelievably incredible that both towers collapsed in such a seemingly controlled manner. If towers / buildings collapsed like that by design, building demolition companies wouldn&amp;#8217;t have a job&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>petition: The President Broke the Law
 President Bush admitted to personally authorizing thousands of allegedly illegal wiretaps, and he doesn&amp;#8217;t plan to stop. Circumventing the Constitution is serious business.
This is a big moment. People from across the political spectrum are standing together to protect the rule of law and the principles that are core to our identity as Americans.
Can you sign this petition to show Congress that Americans want a thorough investigation of the president&amp;#8217;s secret wiretapping program?</description>

      <description>It my (Alan&amp;#8217;s) 27th birthday today.
Thanks to all who have sent cards, emails, IMs, phone calls, etc to wish me a happy one. I&amp;#8217;m rather surprised so many people have remembered. Also, special thanks to the &amp;#8220;check givers&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; all that money is going into savings to replenish the money that was withdrawn to pay for our new bed (soon to arrive).
I&amp;#8217;m surprised to see that so many people sent jokes (or at least comments) about how old I was getting.</description>

Those of you who still run into problems with adware and spyware, you might want to try this app out&amp;#8230; it couldn&amp;#8217;t hurt (unless it was a really clever double-agent type scam to get you to install it. no &amp;#8211; i don&amp;#8217;t think it is&amp;#8230;.. yes, it might be.</description>

      <description>Here is a great interview with Noam Chomsky entitled There Is No War On Terror. Some of my favorite quotes from it, follow:
 This is even sometimes discussed. You can find it in the strategic analysis literature. Take, say, the invasion of Iraq again. We&amp;#8217;re told that they didn&amp;#8217;t find weapons of mass destruction. Well, that&amp;#8217;s not exactly correct. They did find weapons of mass destruction, namely, the ones that had been sent to Saddam by the United States, Britain, and others through the 1980s.</description>

      <description>I am excited to hear about the possible investigation for the impeachment of Bush (I&amp;#8217;ve been calling for it for a while). Too bad it&amp;#8217;s not something that I am hearing much about &amp;#8211; you all? No? You&amp;#8217;d think the investigation for presidential impeachment might be discussed on the evening news, eh? Kind of big news&amp;#8230; it sure was when it was discussed as a possibility for Clinton. But not for Bush (yet).</description>

Colleagues force DeLay to relinquish grip on leadership of House]1 on The Guardian. I have already heard about this on blackwednesday.org, but it&amp;#8217;s a story that makes me smile.
Probably not as pleased as Al Franken, or many of the other people who really know how bad DeLay is&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;ve only heard what others (including Al Franken) have told me&amp;#8230; but it&amp;#8217;s enough to make me fear and loath him.</description>

Here are complete instructions for how to download Real Audio streams and convert them to MP3 (or really, whatever) format:

The tool for Windows is Flashget and for Linux, it&amp;#8217;s simply mplayer.</description>

      <description>It will be my 27th birthday in on Jan 17th. That is not exciting, but I&amp;#8217;m going to try to use it as a ploy to get you (yes &amp;#8211; you, the person reading this right now) to give me a present.
It wont take money, and really only say&amp;#8230; 10 minutes of your time.
Please (please) read the following article:
 Blair Criminalizes His Critics by John Pilger.
 So many people have put what I would like to be able to say, more succinctly and convincingly than I can&amp;#8230; so read their work.</description>

      <description>Over 750,000 people have signed on to a letter urging the Senate to reject Samuel Alito&amp;#8217;s nomination to the Supreme Court. If you sign on, we&amp;#8217;re that much closer to making it a full one million: Sign the letter, (I did).
You can also use MoveOn.org to send a letter to your senator about Alito.
Personally, I think the lifetime apointments of Supreme Court Justices is dangerous in it&amp;#8217;s own right, but I can understand it to some extent&amp;#8230; I just think it&amp;#8217;s dangerous that the court can sway &amp;#8211; and then be stuck in it&amp;#8217;s sway for so long.</description>

      <description>Before we went to Houston, Anita and I spent some time in Louisville.
We were able to see some friends and a good amount of family. We missed out on the big family events, as we were in Houston then&amp;#8230; but we still got to play some games and relax and eat and all the basic events of together-hood.
I worked in the Louisville office, but because most people weren&amp;#8217;t there, I was able to get more work done than I usually do when I go into the office&amp;#8230; but still less than I can get done at home&amp;#8230; weird, huh?</description>

      <description>I spent many full and well populated days in Houston. Anita and I spent nights at various family houses, ate some of the best food we had eaten all year, and most importantly &amp;#8211; got to spend good time with our family together.
Here are some of the highlights:
 Great quality time with family (can&amp;#8217;t mention it enough &amp;#8211; strange that just spending time is so important, so simple, and so rare) Got to meet Scott&amp;#8217;s girlfriend, Ilah (ee-lah) Good but sad visits with my grandmother [Penny]1 Games played : rummykub, canasta, hearts, pictionary, balderdash, ping pong (I won at ping-pong and sometime I won at canasta, but lost everything else) Food, food, and food (including some mango salsa I made, which everyone appeared to appreciate) Ikea blitz &amp;#8211; a 1 hour run through ikea resulting in a total bill of less than $150 for Anita and myself (incredible for us consumer sheep)  One of the important parts which gets a bit of a review is my visit with my grandmother &amp;#8220;Penny&amp;#8221;, who has Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s.</description>

      <description>So, when flying to Houston, early on Monday the 19th of December I ran into a slight problem.
I went through security without issue, and my laptop bag had to go through&amp;#8230; and I overheard security people being called over, waited, and heard a couple of other security people being called over. About this time I get nervous and soon overhear something I would rather not have heard.
Apparently, I had forgotten that I had put some gifts in my laptop bag, that I got for people at work in Japan&amp;#8230; They were very unimpressive, unassuming, decoration-only, ummm, throwing stars.</description>

      <description>We are getting our stuff together to leave columbus for a while. We have house-sitters / cat-sitters for the majority of the time we are gone&amp;#8230; and we are bringing Nova with us, to Louisville.
We are also bringing Ginni&amp;#8217;s queen sized mattress (strapped to the roof of the CRV with ratchet-straps and bungies). That will make for a slightly slower drive, but shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too bad (I hope). In addition, it will be Anita, Alan, John, and Nova in the car with a few weeks worth of stuff for all.</description>

Luckily, the fires at my work seem to be more under control and Anita is, as of today, done with her tests&amp;#8230; She of course doesn&amp;#8217;t know her results, but I&amp;#8217;m sure she&amp;#8217;s doing fine&amp;#8230;</description>

Unfortunately, though suspicious, I did provide my street address&amp;#8230; I resisted, but he read it off to me, and I confirmed it&amp;#8230; what are you gonna do? Also, I suppose he knows my phone number, since he called me on it.
Then he gave me the 800 number 800-591-7398 (8005917398) as a number to find out more about what they are offering.</description>

      <description>1000th &amp;ldquo;Death Penalty&amp;rdquo; murder since reinstating in 1976
Doesn&amp;rsquo;t it seem strange to be killing people for killing people?&amp;nbsp; I am aware that there are people that are dangerous enough to never let back into the population, but it seems hypocritical to kill them&amp;hellip; Aside from the people who are significant dangers to our society, prisons should generally be cleared out a lot.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

      <description>Anyone else getting a flood of blog comment spam recently?
WordPress is awesome enough to catch all of it as probably spam and put it into a moderation queue for me, but I still had 80+ comments to delete in the past week&amp;#8230; and I have to be careful not to delete a non-spam comment&amp;#8230; not a good situation.
So I looked into plug-ins for WordPress and found a few, but the one I liked the most is called bad behavior.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been encouraging her to do this&amp;#8230; though her ~10 hours of work a week doesn&amp;#8217;t sound like much, since she does ~60 hours a week of school work &amp;#8211; a few extra hours to relax would be welcome.

Until I offer those options (look in the top right hand corner of the page for them) you&amp;#8217;ll have to make due with this one.

      <description>So now M$ is releaseing a version meant to cluster computers, you know, like a beowulf cluster.&amp;nbsp; This is one of the worst Ideas I could think of.&amp;nbsp;
Why would you use a flaky, high-overhead,&amp;nbsp;and often to crash OS to run distrobuted processing? There is no good reason, in my opinion. If you are willing to dedicate multiple computers to be a &amp;ldquo;super-computer&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; you should be willing to hire a linux geek to setup and run the thing for you&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; if you wanted to run windows, you don&amp;rsquo;t need a super-computer.</description>

      <description>After reading the article: CIA prisons leak &amp;#8216;to be probed&amp;#8217;, I was overcome one specific emotion: unease (fear)&amp;#8230; The fact that there are secret prisons and nobody knows about them scares the hell out of me.
Basically, if I was taken to prison for thinking our current government sucks (or for being too cynical or too naive), I would want people to know about it&amp;#8230; and hopefully make a fuss&amp;#8230; you know&amp;#8230; maybe get to talk to a lawyer and not be tortured.</description>

 PHP catching on at enterprises, vying with Java Not only is it cool my boss sent it to me, but the content of the article is great news for anyone who is a fan of PHP&amp;#8230; (and anyone who doesn&amp;#8217;t know if they are or not, I very much am&amp;#8230; so if you can&amp;#8217;t form your own opinion on the topic, you may borrow mine) As more and more businesses realize the power, flexibility, and simplicity of PHP &amp;#8211; as it comes into the mainstream more and more &amp;#8211; I get more chances to work with it, teach friends about it, get paid to build stuff with it&amp;#8230; etc.</description>

      <description>So, in August, apparentally, Jeno went to Peru&amp;#8230; It looks like she toured the countryside and hiked up mountains&amp;#8230; went to the amazon rainforest, boated across pink-dolphin infested waters, and got friendly with sheep and mules alike.
I want the full story&amp;#8230; if i get it I will post it somewhere&amp;#8230;. perhaps I can convince her to start a blog of her own&amp;#8230;</description>

Well, as with pretty much all DJ Foursquare (and hushabye house) parties, this was a great event. Chill people, great crowd, good venue (effective at least), great music, etc&amp;#8230; It also benifited from a great collection of costumes and a very moderate and (sorry for this review) disney-land-like bondage show&amp;#8230; Honestly, I don&amp;#8217;t think the crew was disney-land&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure they had to weak-i-fy their setup/show for the audience invovled.</description>

What might have been frustrating was that it was cold and rainy today, starting to be really ugly right about the time we started playing&amp;hellip; but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t frustrating at all.</description>

Anyway, so I tried again, I&amp;nbsp;entered &amp;ldquo;incompetent&amp;rdquo; and hit &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m feeling lucky&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; and I got&amp;nbsp;The President as Incompetent Liar.&amp;nbsp; I read this article, BTW, and it is very well done, I think.</description>

      <description>I just took a Typology Test and ended up as ENFJ which broke down as the following:
 [17%] Extroverted [25%] Intuitive [12%] Feeling [67%] Judging  You can read more about the ENFJ type by looking at the following descriptions&amp;hellip; one by D.Keirsey&amp;nbsp;and one by J. Butt.
Update &amp;#8211; Oct. 11
I found out that according to the Typology tests, the perfect match for ENFJ is ISFJ, and Anita is who got me to take the test&amp;#8230; So, I had to find out what her type was&amp;#8230; and of coruse, she&amp;#8217;s ISFJ.</description>

Since I&amp;rsquo;m on the topic, I want to recommend anyone interested in energy conservationism (or conservationism in general) in the Louisville Kentucky area to check out the BRKST wiki (breakset resources and knowledge for sustainable thought) run by Jason Smithson.</description>

Wiki is already a fantastic tool for simple (or complex) content management, accessible to anyone within a few minutes&amp;#8230; This proposed innovation would add the ability to add, inline, extra relationships which build a more complete (and interoperable) logical structure.</description>

The themes are driven primarily by CSS, and done in such a way as to allow simple variations in how things should look&amp;hellip; there will be an &amp;ldquo;options&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;selector on the top-right and it will allow you to easily choose theme options and it saves your options as a cookie (if you allow the cookie) or session variables if your don&amp;rsquo;t allow the cookies.</description>

Rita, as a Category 3 hurricane (120 mph) made landfall at 2:30 a.m. CDT today in extreme southwest Louisiana between Sabine Pass and Johnson&amp;#8217;s Bayou, La. Port Arthur, Texas, clocked maximum wind gusts of 116 mph, while Beaumont, Texas, measured 105 mph. Cameron, La., reported a gust to 112 mph before the anemometer failed. Storm surge flooding of up to 15 feet probably occured just east of where the eye thundered ashore.</description>

(sorry, the link requires login)
Apparently, after a few rather agressive (not phiscally) confrontations with creationists, in science museums &amp;#8211; docents and volunteers are flocking to training on how to best respond to such challenges.
&amp;#8220;The goal is to understand the controversies, so that people are better able to handle them as they come up,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;Museums, as a field, have recognized we need to take a more proactive role in evolution education.</description>

Breaking with tradition under which US presidents mute criticisms of their successors, Clinton said the Bush administration had decided to invade Iraq &amp;#8220;virtually alone and before UN inspections were completed, with no real urgency, no evidence that there were weapons of mass destruction.&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8230;
&amp;#8220;What Americans need to understand is that &amp;#8230; every single day of the year, our government goes into the market and borrows money from other countries to finance Iraq, Afghanistan, Katrina, and our tax cuts,&amp;#8221; he said.</description>

      <description>Many new photos of our kittens are now avaialble, including a really cute one of Jess and Io (on the right).&amp;nbsp; Below are some of my favorites:
 Thebe&amp;rsquo;s bath Thebe in a cup Thebe and Io in bowls  There are also a few new photos of Nova and some of my Dad&amp;rsquo;s kittens we brought him, but they will have to be featured in a different posting.</description>

      <description>So &amp;#8211; Capture the Flag was a lot of fun. We played at the Park of Roses on August 21 2005 (after sundown). We had 9 people show and had a great time, though we were out classed severely by some &amp;#8220;in shape&amp;#8221; players. I&amp;#8217;m hoping to end up with more people in a bigger area for the next game on September 9th (friday) at an unknown location.
Google is incredible.</description>

      <description>Recent News:
Skin Cells Converted to Stem Cells which means we have &amp;#8220;starter cells&amp;#8221; for transplants and the like and don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about the moral issues raised from using the tissues of aborted fetuses (feti?). [Bush&amp;rsquo;s statement on this]
I&amp;#8217;ve heard of this before, though&amp;#8230; In fact, in a previous article from the Washing Post. My question really is, what is the quantity we are talking about? If we could produce enough stem cells to generate real tissues, doesn&amp;#8217;t that kinda sound like vat grown replacement parts&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>I took the kittens to the vet yesterday. It turns out they&amp;#8217;re only 6 weeks old and they are both males. We have also decided on names for them. The black one is henceforth Thebe, and the white and orange one is Io. These are the names of 2 of Jupiter&amp;#8217;s moons, so we were able to stick with the science theme afterall!</description>

      <description>We have kittens.

That&amp;#8217;s right, it&amp;#8217;s cute-fest-2005 in our apartment right now. We got a pair of 8 6 week old kittens on Sunday from Anita&amp;#8217;s co-worker who got them dumped on her by her mom. They are a brother (black) and sister (white &amp;amp; orange) and have very quickly bonded with Anita and I&amp;#8230; they are ok with Nova, but she&amp;#8217;s not yet ok with them. Nova actually submitted to them, belly up and looking away; our guard dog proving her grit once again.</description>

      <description>From an email from April:
_However, I did want to let everyone know that I am
safe and perfectly whole after this morning&amp;#8217;s earthquake. For those of you
who have no idea what I&amp;#8217;m talking about, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit
Japan at 11:46 this morning and I was a mere 60 some-odd kilometers south of
its center of its origin. It&amp;#8217;s on the front page of BBC, CNN, MSN-NBC, etc.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything interesting going on right now, so here&amp;rsquo;s some of the stuff going on in the world today (that I was interested in):
techie stuff
 Google snubs tech news outlet CNET&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Google CEO got &amp;ldquo;googled&amp;rdquo; and is upset about the demonstration of people&amp;rsquo;s complain at all the personal information readily available&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s just that the info is so easy to get at&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; (personally, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me &amp;ndash; information is simply information, not all of it is true but whatever is, should be available&amp;hellip; in&amp;nbsp;my ideal world there would be no need to worry about privacy concerns&amp;hellip; too bad we&amp;rsquo;re not there yet.</description>

      <description>Well, I&amp;#8217;m finally done with updating the backlogged Japan blog entries. It was something I kept putting off, but I&amp;#8217;m real glad I did it &amp;#8211; the posts are kinda long, but it&amp;#8217;s as much for my memory of the trip as anyone else&amp;#8217;s (sorry).
 I&amp;#8217;m impressed that within 45 minutes of uploading the lastest batch of photos, some of them have been looked at 4 times already&amp;#8230; I know I&amp;#8217;m just getting lucky, but it still nice to know someone is looking.</description>

      <description>Anita and I were planning on staying up all Monday night and going to the Tokyo Fish Market at 5 am on Tuesday, but around 3am we crashed. Anita got up at 4:30 and fully intended to get me up, but she saw that a sub-tropical-storm was headed at Tokyo and that it was already raining pretty hard… There’s something about being dog tired and lost in a city that is much worse sounding if you add in the attribute &amp;#8211; rain soaked.</description>

      <description>After the late night before, we all slept in… Anita and I slept in so much we missed our hotel’s breakfast. We found a snack and took the subway to the Tokyo Aquarium. It was totally disappointing. The animals had very small enclosures, particularly bothersome were the mammals. There were many dead or dirty exhibits and not too much to read in English… We left after (something like) an hour and a half and roamed the “Sunshine 60” shopping complex (basically a big mall like the galleria in Houston without the ice skating rink).</description>

      <description>Another morning of repacking, a walk to the station, and a train ride to Tokyo (~3 hours)… most people napped (I read).
 We got out at Tokyo and took a subway to the hotel, dropped off our packs, and walked around to find food. Ironically, our hotel was right next to Akihabara, the Electronic Market in Tokyo, and it was Sunday, a day so busy the street is shut down to vehicles and the area is swarmed with geeks of all varieties and the people that feed on/off them.</description>

      <description>On our second full day in Kyoto we ate the last of the Fruit and some of the granola bars for breakfast; then we hopped on the #100 bus for the east side of Kyoto to see Ginkakuji-michi (the Silver Temple). The Silver Temple was much better than the Golden Temple because it was less overrun with tourists and also because the surrounding gardens were amazing. The cultivation of moss is, itself, remarkable, but to see the whole garden come together is quite impressive.</description>

      <description>We got an early start, showered, dressed, and set out for the train station to buy bus passes before 8:00 am. 2,000 Yen for a 2 day all bus all subway pass is a good deal… also because it means you don’t have to pay attention to which company bus or subway you want to use, because in the city of Kyoto there are at least 3-4 different companies for public transit and most other passes don’t cover them all.</description>

      <description>We finished packing for a couple of hours and then took way too much stuff down to the Koori-Machi train station. We caught the 15 minute train to Fukushima and stuffed our packs into lockers at the train station there. (Except my pack, which wouldn’t fit in any of the lockers)
We then went to the 100 Yen store – the Japanese equivalent of the $1.00 store, but much, much cooler.</description>

      <description>Wednesday, we went to the elementary school April visits a few times a week. We did a brief tour of the classes and had an audience with the principal and vice-principal. The school seemed wonderful, but we didn’t have as much time to spend there as we did in Jo-Chu. We had to rush through the school, stop for a quick Ramen lunch, and be back at April’s apartment in time for Karen to receive a several wonderful gifts from some of April’s students who were in Elizabethtown last year.</description>

      <description>Tuesday 19 July 2005, we dressed in our nice clothes, carried our own house slippers so we didn’t have to use visitor slippers, and walked to Jo-Ho Chugakko Junior High School, known as Jo-Chu. Arriving at school a few minutes early (which was really on time) we met with the principal (Coach O’Sensei). Immediately we were amazed with how generous he was&amp;#8230; treating us like honored guests would be putting it mildly.</description>

      <description>This morning we ate fruit, cereal, and granola before setting out for Mount Azuma. We took the Aizu Bandi Skyline (highway) for some beautiful but quite frightening driving in the mountains. A couple hours of hair-pin turns and sulfur smelling air later, we ended up at Mount Azuma. It’s a large (dormant?) volcano crater in the midst of a gorgeous mountain range. We walked around the crater, against some very serious winds.</description>

      <description>Saturday we took a local train to Fukushima and ate lunch at our first Japanese restaurant&amp;#8230; it was spectacular! It was a friend of a friend&amp;#8217;s dad&amp;#8217;s restaurant and we ended up being there 20 minutes before they opened, but they let us in and sat us by the window looking out onto their wonderful and very small garden. We had pork medallions and miso and cabbage salads and rice &amp;#8211; I had a curry dish.</description>

      <description>24 hours, is a long time to travel.
We flew to Chicago from Louisville, but got delayed on the runway in Louisville; so we had to run in Chicago to make it to our connecting flight to Tokyo&amp;#8230; we made it though, and started our ~11.5 hour flight.
The plane ride was fine, in that really long and tiring kinda way. We were good and stayed awake (mostly) in order to sync our sleep cycle with Japan which is almost exactly the opposite of our timezone.</description>

      <description>I have implemented a blogging system on my site (utilizing WordPress) and modified the display of my wiki to play well with the blog&amp;#8230; The basics of the change are making the content fixed width, and moving the &amp;#8220;article, discussion, edit, history, etc&amp;#8221; tabs to a sidebar component on the wiki&amp;#8230; then coming up with a shared header&amp;#8230;
I still need to get the old blog entries into this system (very do-able), and I am thinking a homepage not in the wiki, is appropriate&amp;#8230; either that or i should get rid of the &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221; link in the header&amp;#8230; hurumph &amp;#8211; i think i&amp;#8217;m going to remove the &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221; link in the header now (since it&amp;#8217;s the same as the wiki link for now).</description>

Introduction
I fix things, or try. Often breaking them till they work or they don&amp;rsquo;t. This applies to programs, web applications, websites, computers, artwork, food, friendships, relationships, people, and anything else I devote energy to.
Since fatherhood, the amount of time devoted to pretty much anything else has been drastically reduced. The amount of time devoted to my wonderful family has seen a significant increase; all is right with my very small part of the world, and I am truly grateful.</description>
