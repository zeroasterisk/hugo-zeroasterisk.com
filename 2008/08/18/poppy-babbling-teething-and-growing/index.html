                        <p>Poppy is growing up way too quickly. Anita cried a couple nights ago</p>

<p>watching her sleep, and I can certainly understand&#8230; She hasn&#8217;t</p>

<p>technically doubled in size, but she seems like she is at least twice</p>

<p>as big as she was at birth and many hundred fold more</p>

<p>capable/developed/skilled/aware.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s babbling a lot, starting this weekend and she has a second tooth just under the surface ready to come out.</p>

<p>Crawling is considered a given, and in fact any time her mobility is restricted for too long (60-120 seconds?) she&#8217;ll let you know exactly what she thinks about it. Pops can pull herself up from sitting to standing if there&#8217;s something stable around&#8230; she is even moving herself around into positions where that is possible. She has only gotten herself to sitting a few times.</p>

<p>We have decided to defend Nova (our dog) whenever she&#8217;s on her dog-bed. The rest of the time, Poppy crawls over to Nova and tries to touch/grab her&#8230; and Nova gets up and moves away. We&#8217;ve treat the dog-bed as &#8220;base&#8221; and try to keep Poppy from getting to her there. That&#8217;s the extent of their interactions for the most part, but judging as so, they are getting along quite well.</p>

<p>Poppy is showing the earmarks of being a handful. Still one of the happiest and easiest babies to deal with, she has no fear at all. The roomba started up next to her, the first time she&#8217;s ever seen it&#8230; and instead of being scared like a normal baby &#8211; she chased after it. She bit her momma while nursing (one very sharp tooth) and Anita yelled at her &#8220;NO!&#8221;. Again most babies would cry or backup or something&#8230; Poppy laughed, &#8220;<em>what game is this?</em>&#8221; She&#8217;s taken a few falls and spills and caught a face full of water a few times&#8230; all with almost no crying or scare (at least no more than a few seconds of crying, when she&#8217;s actually hurt herself). It&#8217;s great&#8230; but we fear she may have no fear, a trait which helped her pappa get several broken bones while growing up.</p>

<p>No photos uploaded&#8230; We&#8217;ve taken them&#8230; but havn&#8217;t uploaded recently.. I will sometime.</p>
