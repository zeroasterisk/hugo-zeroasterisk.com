I just got done reading the article: [

Colleagues force DeLay to relinquish grip on leadership of House][1] on [The Guardian][2]. I have [already heard about this][3] on [blackwednesday.org][4], but it&#8217;s a story that makes me smile.

Probably not as pleased as [Al Franken][5], or many of the other people who _really_ know how bad DeLay is&#8230; I&#8217;ve only heard what others (including Al Franken) have told me&#8230; but it&#8217;s enough to make me fear and loath him.

Oh, and, by no means does me being _right_ about DeLay mean my other fears about our government are correct&#8230; but perhaps they are slightly less dismissible.

Also&#8230;.

Articles:

  * [Losing the War on Terrorism: Our Incompetent Commander in Chief][6]
&#8212; A very intelligent look at what has happened, what hasn&#8217;t happened, and what should be happening (it&#8217;s a bit long, but very worth reading). </ul>

News:

  * [US troops seize award-winning Iraqi journalist][7]
  * [MPs leaked Bush plan to bomb al-Jazeera][8]
