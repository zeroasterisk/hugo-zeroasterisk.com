Ok &#8211; yeah, she&#8217;s only 15 days old today&#8230; sounds like nothing&#8230; but she is already changing.&nbsp; Her head is getting more solid and her face seems to be solidifying (for want of a better term).

Poppy is getting big.&nbsp; She&#8217;s still under 10 lbs, but she&#8217;s moving more, making want-to-be-crawling motions when on her belly&#8230; and is more prone to recognize people around her.

She&#8217;s starting to be unhappy when she realizes people aren&#8217;t holding her or at least around her&#8230; but that might not be new &#8211; it&#8217;s just new that people aren&#8217;t always holding her.

We&#8217;re grasping to every moment as best as possible&#8230;
