[Five questions that will dictate your personality for the rest of your life.][1]




> I don&#8217;t get it. It&#8217;s like those people who go around with those t-shirts and stickers that say &#8220;you laugh at me because I&#8217;m different, but I laugh at you because you&#8217;re all the same.&#8221; How different are you if you&#8217;re wearing a mass-produced t-shirt with a registered trade mark sold through one of the largest clothing franchises in the world? You&#8217;re the reason Old Navy keeps making stupid commercials, and you&#8217;re the reason McDonalds gets away with selling so much shitty food every day.</p>
Yeah&#8230; i agree&#8230; i don&#8217;t want to accuse everyone, but i suspect we are all guilty to some extent&#8230; most especially anyone with an &#8220;I&#8217;m unique&#8221; T-shirt.
