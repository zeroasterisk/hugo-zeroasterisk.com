If anyone in _the &#8216;ville_ hasn&#8217;t heard about the [New Skyscraper for Louisville][1] &#8211; check it out&#8230; It looks really cool (in my opinion) and would be a great thing to claim for the city&#8230; not to mention, it&#8217;d be very nice to have a modern art museum (in a building island, no less).

Also &#8211; a [new google desktop search][2] looks good (as expected).
