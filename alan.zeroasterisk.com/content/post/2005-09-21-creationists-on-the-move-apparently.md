[Challenged by Creationists, Museums Answer Back][1]

<small>(sorry, the link requires login)</small>

Apparently, after a few rather agressive (not phiscally) confrontations with creationists, in science museums &#8211; docents and volunteers are flocking to training on how to best respond to such challenges.

 _&#8220;The goal is to understand the controversies, so that people are better able to handle them as they come up,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Museums, as a field, have recognized we need to take a more proactive role in evolution education.&#8221;_

 _Dr. Allmon, who directs the Paleontological Research Institution, an affiliate of Cornell University, began the training session here in September with statistics from Gallup Polls: 54 percent of Americans do not believe that human beings evolved from earlier species, and although almost half believe that Darwin has been proved right, slightly more disagree._

 _&#8220;Just telling them they are wrong is not going to be effective,&#8221; he said._
