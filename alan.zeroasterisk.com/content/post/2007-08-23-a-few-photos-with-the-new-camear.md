    Big thanks to <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com">kenrockwell.com</a>; <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/d200-d80-d70-d50-d40-5d-xti.htm">his reviews</a> really helped make our decisions for us. We made sure to use his link to Amazon to buy the camera and I&#8217;d encourage others who are interested in a great SLR camera to use his site and do the same. Thank Ken, whoever you are.
