we had a date last night (our first in 6+ months) and ate Ethiopian food and watched &#8220;<a href="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/">Iron Man</a>&#8220;. Both the food and the movie were fantastic!

Maybe it&#8217;s because we haven&#8217;t really had a night to ourselves in a while; maybe it&#8217;s because we haven&#8217;t seen a movie in a few months&#8230; but we both loved every second of our date and I personally will be re watching iron man a few times.</div>
