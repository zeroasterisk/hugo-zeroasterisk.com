This is about the best news ever.&nbsp; (my stomach thinks so)

We just heard about this today, and went to [Maido&#8217;s][1] (in Louisville, KY &#8211; [map][2])&#8230;. it was absolutely fantastic!

For less than $9, you get to pick over some of the best Japanese food in Louisville.&nbsp; As of now, it&#8217;s only been open for lunch for about a week and there were few people there.&nbsp; So go quick.

I suspect when word of this gets out, it will either stop or get ridiculously busy.
