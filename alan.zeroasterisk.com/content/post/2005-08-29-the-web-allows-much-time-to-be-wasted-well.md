**Roger Ebert** gives an][4] to a response to his review of&nbsp;the movie &ldquo;[Chaos][5]&rdquo; (complicated).&nbsp; I really liked what he said and I agree with it something like 80%&ndash;90%&hellip; the only parts I really disagree with is&hellip; art can easily be the things we don&rsquo;t want, with no hope and no redeeming value.&nbsp; Art has no rules and no needs.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t mean he shouldn&rsquo;t tell people it&rsquo;s horrible and not to see the movie; I just have to throw out there that one can not define art into a boundry (put a boundry on art, and the most important thing to&nbsp;many artists&nbsp;becomes destroying that boundry).
