> _&#8220;I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil.&#8221;_

> There are so many, still, who &#8220;can’t handle the truth,&#8221; and that is all too understandable. I have found it a wrenching experience to be forced to conclude that the America I love would **deliberately launch what the Nuremburg Tribunal called the &#8220;supreme international crime&#8221; – a war of aggression – largely for oil**. For those who are able to overcome the very common, instinctive denial, for those who can handle the truth, it really helps to turn off the Sunday football games early enough to catch up on what’s going on. &#8212; Source: [Greenspan Misses Cheney&#8217;s Memo: Spills the Beans on Oil][2]
