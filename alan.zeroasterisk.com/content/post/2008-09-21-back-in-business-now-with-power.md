Saturday night we got back home and were amazed to see lights on.&nbsp; LG&E rigged up some scary looking connections across downed lines (we will not go walking on stilts), but they got our block light up&#8230; faster than I expected. 

We were without power for right at a week, and it certainly could have been much worse.&nbsp; We had no damage and no monetary loss (except the food in the fridge/freezer).&nbsp; Pretty much, it was like wussy-camping.&nbsp; I worked at Via and charged my phone there&#8230; we walked and visited with neighbors and ate out after our food spoiled.&nbsp; Kinda fun, really.
