There is a beta of a [site][1] that allows anyone to create a group, and people can add themselves / photos to it, and where they are at&#8230; it uses [google maps][2] API to plot the photos on a map&#8230; really neat stuff in my opinion&#8230; so anyone who wants to spend 2 minutes to see if they are even mildly impressed / interested / entertained&#8230; go to <http://www.frappr.com/zeroasterisk> and &#8220;add yourself&#8221;.
