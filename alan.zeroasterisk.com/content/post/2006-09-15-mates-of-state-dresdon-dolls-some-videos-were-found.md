I got an email to view a video on mtvu.com, but thier crappy player wouldn&#8217;t work on windows XP pro 64&#8230;&nbsp; so, I went looking for other videos by them:

  * [For the Actor &#8211; Mates of State &#8211; Google Video][1]
  * [Mates of State &#8212; Ha Ha &#8211; Google Video][2][Mates of State &#8211; Goods (Its All In Your Head) &#8211; Google Video][3]

That&#8217;s all the MOS I could find&#8230; though there was a funny &#8220;dancing to&#8221; video [here][3] and a video commentary: { [Mates Of State &#8220;Fraud In The 80&#8217;s&#8221; with director commentary by Arno Salters][4] }.

So, I searched for some other stuff and found some good Dresdon Dolls videos

  * [The Dresden Dolls &#8211; &#8220;Coin-Operated Boy&#8221; &#8211; Google Video][5]
  * [The Dresden Dolls &#8211; &#8220;Sing (Chapter II)&#8221; &#8211; Google Video][6]
  * [The Dresden Dolls &#8211; &#8220;Girl Anachronism&#8221; &#8211; Google Video][7]
  * [The Dresden Dolls &#8211; &#8220;War Pigs&#8221; (Live &#8211; 2004) &#8211; Google Video][8]
  * [The Dresden Dolls &#8211; &#8220;Half Jack&#8221; (Live &#8211; 2005) &#8211; Google Video][9]
