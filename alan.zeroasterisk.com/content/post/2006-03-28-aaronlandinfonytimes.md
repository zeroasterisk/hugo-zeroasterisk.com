Interesting link : [http://aaronland.info/nytimes/][1]

Read the blurb at the top and then click on the first link [http://aaronland.info/nytimes/related/].

The top image is a map where the top NY Times stories are plotted&#8230; but below that is a thought-map, of sorts&#8230; a link-chart of buzzwords.

kinda neat&#8230; to see that almost everything links to &#8220;violence&#8221; and that the &#8220;united church of christ&#8221; links only to &#8220;churches&#8221;, &#8220;television&#8221;, and &#8220;advertising&#8221;.

just random / interesting.

**UPDATE**

My uncle sent me the following, somewhat related link : [http://www.wburg.com/0202/arts/lombardi.html][2]. It&#8217;s a good read and similar to the above discussed thought-map (but more visually appealing).
