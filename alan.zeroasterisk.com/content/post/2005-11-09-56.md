After reading the article:  [CIA prisons leak &#8216;to be probed&#8217;][1], I was overcome one specific emotion: unease (fear)&#8230; The fact that there are secret prisons and nobody knows about them scares the hell out of me. 

Basically, if I was taken to prison for thinking our current government sucks (or for being too cynical or too naive), I would want people to know about it&#8230; and hopefully make a fuss&#8230; you know&#8230; maybe get to talk to a lawyer and not be tortured. Perhaps I&#8217;m asking a lot, but I was raised in a country where such things were valued as the baseline for decency and fairness&#8230; To think that I could instead be whisked off to a prison that people don&#8217;t even know about in a different country&#8230; well, I thought Jose Pedilla had it bad (and indeed he does), but at least we know where he is&#8230; well, we think we do &#8211; he&#8217;s not allowed to see a lawyer either. 

Yes &#8211; i&#8217;m scared. 

When I start seeing people getting pushed into cattle cars, what should I do? Run for Canada or see if I can fight the regime? (I&#8217;m not a very good fighter, to my knowledge&#8230; of course, I&#8217;m not a great runner either)

On a different and slightly more humorous note, here&#8217;s a funny piece about [Kansas lowering it&#8217;s public education standards][2]. Too bad, science used to make sense when theories were based on provable axioms&#8230;
