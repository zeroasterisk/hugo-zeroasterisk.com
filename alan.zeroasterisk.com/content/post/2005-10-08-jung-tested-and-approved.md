I just took a  [Typology Test][1] and ended up as **ENFJ** which broke down as the following:

  * [17%] Extroverted
  * [25%] Intuitive
  * [12%] Feeling
  * [67%] Judging

You can read more about the **ENFJ** type by looking at the following descriptions&hellip; [one by D.Keirsey][2]&nbsp;and [one by J. Butt][3].

* * *

**Update &#8211; Oct. 11**

I found out that according to the Typology tests, the perfect match for **ENFJ** is **ISFJ**, and Anita is who got me to take the test&#8230; So, I had to find out what her _type_ was&#8230; and of coruse, she&#8217;s **ISFJ**. I didn&#8217;t need a silly multiple choice test to tell me we are perfect for each other&#8230; but it&#8217;s kinda nice the test agrees.

You can read more about the **ISFJ** type by looking at the following descriptions&hellip; [one by D.Keirsey][4]&nbsp;and [one by J. Butt][5].
