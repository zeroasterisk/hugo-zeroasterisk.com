As you can see, I&#8217;m looking into my options for employment. I have a few leads, but would like to explore all of my options&#8230; at least all of the options I can get in quickly, as I&#8217;d like to have a choice made by late January.

  * [1-page resume][1]
  * [2-page resume][2]

Ideally, I&#8217;d like to find a position which afforded me the opportunity to manage, design, and develop web-based projects / solutions. Much of my focus has been on development and programming; I would like to stay on that side of things, though I&#8217;m also quite interested in user interface and graphic design.
