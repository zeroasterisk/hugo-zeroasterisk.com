        The Pig type is usually an honest, straightforward and patient<br /> person. They are a modest, shy character who prefers to work quietly<br /> behind the scenes. When others despair, they are often there to offer<br /> support. This type of person is reserved with those they do not know<br /> too well, but as time passes and they gain confidence, those around<br /> them may discover a lively and warm-hearted person behind that mask of<br /> aloofness. Despite those born in the year of pig having a wide circle<br /> of friends and acquaintances, they have few close friends who<br /> understand them and share their inner thoughts and feelings. It is easy<br /> to put trust in pig type; they won&#8217;t let you down and will never even<br /> attempt to do so. Such people simply want to do everything right<br /> according to social norms.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28zodiac%29#_note-8" title="">[9]</a><br /></sup>

        It is important to remember that these people are not vengeful<br /> creatures. If someone tries to take advantage of them, the pig type<br /> tend to withdraw to reflect on the problem and protect themselves. All<br /> they need in such situations is a little time to find a constructive<br /> way to respond. The people of the pig type are conservative creatures<br /> of habit. They dislike being made to travel too far from familiar<br /> surroundings, unless it is a trip to the countryside. They love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">nature</a> and are never happier than when they are out somewhere, far from the city.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28zodiac%29#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup>

        There is a tolerant and peaceful side to their character. Such<br /> people are never afraid to allow others their freedom of expression;<br /> they do not want to cause arguments and if there is any way to avoid<br /> arguing, they will probably take this option. However, they are not<br /> weak and if the situation forces them to fight these people will rise<br /> to the occasion, whether it is to defend themselves or those close to<br /> them.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28zodiac%29#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup>
