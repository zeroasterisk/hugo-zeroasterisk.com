I would like to take a moment and give praise to Alan. For those who know him, know that he is awesomely quicky, white and nerdy. It gets better when you live with him! I have come home after a bad day several times this quarter, and he has cleaned. We&#8217;re not talking just dishes &#8211; we&#8217;re talkin dishes, sweeping, mopping, cat box, laundry, the whole nine yards. He does these things even though he&#8217;s been working all day and probably hasn&#8217;t had a much better day than I have. I&#8217;m not the easiest person to live with. I&#8217;m needy &#8211; I demand certain amounts of attention, alone time, crazy time and food time. He deals with the need of the moment with seeming ease (most of the time). Seriously, who could ask for a better husband? He&#8217;s the best!
