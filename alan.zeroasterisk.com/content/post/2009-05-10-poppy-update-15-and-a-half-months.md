Poppy is starting to really put things together.  She&#8217;s long been understanding much more than we would have expected, occasionally doing things we ask her to do which we would never anticipate her doing (like asking her to throw something away in another room, and her doing so).  Now she&#8217;s starting to say a few more words, do a few more signs, and saying/signing more clearly.

She&#8217;s had a bit of a rough month, all four of her I-Teeth are coming in.  At the same time, she&#8217;s also trying to exert a bit more independance and is not 100% sure how to go about that.  So she&#8217;s sometimes

PS: she is 472 days old today.
