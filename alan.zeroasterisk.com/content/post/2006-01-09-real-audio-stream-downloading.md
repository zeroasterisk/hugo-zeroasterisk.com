I have looked for this information before, but the planets have aligned and I was able to find what I was looking for.

Here are complete instructions for how to download Real Audio streams and convert them to MP3 (or really, whatever) format:

  * [Windows][1]
  * [Linux][2]

Note: there is actually much more useful information on those pages if you were interested.

The tool for Windows is [Flashget][3] and for Linux, it&#8217;s simply [mplayer][4].

The only reason I&#8217;m really interested is to get some [This American Life][5] episodes onto my iPod&#8230; that will make me happy.
