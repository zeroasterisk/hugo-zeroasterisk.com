I had written a decent post about freedom of speech and that it is mostly a facade, but even that facade is wonderful&#8230; but the post got lost in the ether (more accuratly, my computer rebooted for unknown reasons).

Anyway, here are the news articles prompting the previous post:

  * [Secret government or a free press?][1]{#r-1_0}
  * [&#8220;flag desecration is an unacceptable form of political protest&#8221;][2] &#8212; U.S. SEN. BILL FRIST Â» [Senate Rejects Flag Desecration Amendment][3]

And I ended up reading a chain of wikipedia articles which went something like:

  * [Free speech][4]

  * [Marketplace of ideas][5]

  * [Elsebeth Baumgartner][6]
  * [2005 amendment to the Finnish Copyright Act and Penal Code][7]
  * [Holocaust denial][8]
  * [Tiananmen Square protests of 1989][9] << very informative >>

  * [Pillar of Shame][10]
