  <span>Little poppy is fast and furious these days (at least when she doesn&#8217;t get what she wants, fast enough).  Turn your back and she&#8217;s gone&#8230;. or perhaps she&#8217;s up, as in climbing up furniture.  She&#8217;s eating a lot (sauteed mushrooms and onions and swash and garlic, last night&#8230; mmmm) and still has chubby legs and a belly on her, but for the most part has lengthened out and looks more and more like a kid and less and less like a baby.  She climbs on the playground and slides down the slides and swings on the swings&#8230; all with help still, but with less trepidation than the little she used to show.  </span>

  <span>Anita watches her during the week and I&#8217;ve shifted to a 4 x 10 hour work week, so one day a week (when anita&#8217;s working) I watch her.  That leaves us with only 1 day every other week when both of us are working that a friend of ours watches her.  Today is my day, and she&#8217;s napping (which is how I am able to make this post)&#8230; off to the park after she wakes up.</span>
