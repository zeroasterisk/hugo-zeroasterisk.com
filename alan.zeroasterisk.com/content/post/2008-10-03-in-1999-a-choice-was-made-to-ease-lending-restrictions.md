NY Times article:   
[Fannie Mae Eases Credit To Aid Mortgage Lending : September 30, 1999][1]

> In a move that could help increase home ownership rates among minorities and low-income consumers, the Fannie Mae Corporation is easing the credit requirements on loans that it will purchase from banks and other lenders.
> 
> The action, which will begin as a pilot program involving 24 banks in 15 markets &#8212; including the New York metropolitan region &#8212; will encourage those banks to extend home mortgages to individuals whose credit is generally not good enough to qualify for conventional loans. Fannie Mae officials say they hope to make it a nationwide program by next spring. 
> 
> In addition, banks, thrift institutions and mortgage companies have been pressing Fannie Mae to help them make more loans to so-called subprime borrowers. These borrowers whose incomes, credit ratings and savings are not good enough to qualify for conventional loans, can only get loans from finance companies that charge much higher interest rates &#8212; anywhere from three to four percentage points higher than conventional loans.

By no means is this the sole cause of anything, but it&#8217;s an interesting data-point in looking back to how we got here.
