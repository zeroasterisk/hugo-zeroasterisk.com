Poppy is a feirce 6 months now. She is sitting and crawling and talking a lot (though still mostly in vowels only).

What&#8217;s funny is to see her grab ahold of something (anything) and shake it.

&#8220;What does this do? How about if I beat it against the floor for 5 minutes? hmmm&#8230; What about after another 5 minutes?&#8221;

She is so much fun to watch and interact with&#8230; all she&#8217;s doing is sitting or crawling and violently shaking/beating/eating whatever is in her little hands&#8230; but that&#8217;s more than enough to keep us watching.

Guess those genetic directives seem to be working fine for Anita and I.
