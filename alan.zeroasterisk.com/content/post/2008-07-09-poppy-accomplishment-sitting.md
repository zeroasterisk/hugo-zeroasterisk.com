Most changes are gradual &#8211; including this one&#8230; Poppy is sitting up pretty well now. Over the last two weeks she&#8217;s been getting closet to sitting unaided and most of this week, as long as there&#8217;s a pillow to protect her from occasionally flailing backwards &#8211; she&#8217;s a solid sitter. Amazing how proud I can be over such simple accomplishments.
