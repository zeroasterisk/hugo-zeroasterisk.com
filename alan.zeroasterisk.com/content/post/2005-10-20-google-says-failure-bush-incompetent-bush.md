One more quick note:

I was doing the Google &ldquo;feeling lucky&rdquo; thing, where you enter a word like &ldquo;failure&rdquo; and it gives your it&rsquo;s best result&hellip;&nbsp; Well, for the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; it isn&rsquo;t random, it&rsquo;s&hellip; well&hellip; funny, appropriate, sad&hellip;&nbsp; [Biography of President George W. Bush][1].

Anyway, so I tried again, I&nbsp;entered &ldquo;incompetent&rdquo; and hit &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling lucky&rdquo;&hellip; and I got&nbsp;<!--StartFragment -->

[The President as Incompetent Liar][2].&nbsp; I read this article, BTW, and it is very well done, I think.&nbsp; Well cited and the logic is solid.&nbsp; My cynicism is throbbing.

I&rsquo;m not sure on the associations involved.&nbsp; I started searching for the terms, and both are the top listed results for the searches (incompetent following with Michael Moore)&hellip; so, it seems more valid&hellip; but I couldn&rsquo;t find the word failure anywhere in&nbsp;Bush&rsquo;s&nbsp;Bio.

If google knows something, you&rsquo;d think the rest of the world would pick up on it&hellip;
