Anita, our step sister Maddie (14), and I went to Houston, from July 20 through August 1st.&nbsp; We drove.

First, we drove to and camped at the [Hot Springs National Park][2], during the hottest part of a heat wave.&nbsp; Our A/C could occasionally not keep up, it was so hot&#8230; so when we ended up at the park, we went wading (which turned into swimming for some) in a creek that ran through the park.&nbsp; The park itself was nice enough.&nbsp; A little more developed than I would like, but at the same time much more less than most commercial campgrounds and pretty much what you might expect form a National Park.&nbsp; There were some good trails we barely explored and the setting was pretty, no doubt.&nbsp; It ended up being so hot, Anita and I slept outside of the tent &#8211; preferring insect affliction to heat.

We then finished the drive to Gainesville, TX, quickly &#8211; visiting my Uncle Bob and Aunt Doris.&nbsp; We played [Chicken Foot][4], ate food, went for a drive around town and a walk around the cemetery (I have lots of names I should associate on stone there).&nbsp; Doris and Bob both looked good, and were as warm and friendly as always.&nbsp; They had a small dog ([Shitzu][5]) which was actually really cool for a small dog&#8230; unusual.

After spending the night and the morning in Gainesville, we drove to Rosenberg, TX (southwest of Houston); finally at my mom&#8217;s house.&nbsp; Here we started a pattern we often repeated: playing games, eating food, occasionally starting/doing projects, a lot of waiting on things to start, and enjoying glorious proximity.&nbsp; Some of the highlights include: doing clay projects on mom&#8217;s potter&#8217;s wheel, playing with the chickens (not really playing, but it felt kinda like that to us &#8220;city folk&#8221;), setting up and using the above ground pool (~15&#8242; diameter), playing ping-pong (I got beat by Lucilo), and several good meals.&nbsp; We planned on going fishing in Galveston, but weren&#8217;t able to because of rain &#8211; but that didn&#8217;t stop clay work nor going to museums.

One of the main things that happened was the preparation for and attendance of the &#8220;Celebration of Life&#8221; Memorial Service for my Grandmother: [Margaret RuthPennington (Penny)][7].&nbsp; She died of complications from Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease, after a 15 year struggle.&nbsp; It was sad, but after that long, and her being progressively debilitated for so long, it was almost a relief (for her sake).&nbsp; I plan on writing something specific to her at some point, so I wont go into it too much here, but it was a huge part of that trip &#8211; a theme which brought us together and made us hold on to each other.&nbsp;

After the service and another day of hanging out with family, we headed back home&#8230; at the begining of yet another heat wave.&nbsp; We stayed in a hotel that night, somewhere around Memphis and made it to Louisville, early afternoon on July 31.&nbsp; Anita and I made it back to Columbus on August 1st and tried to relax, as best we could.&nbsp; (~2500 miles traveled)
