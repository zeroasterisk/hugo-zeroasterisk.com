We went to Houston this year, for Poppy&#8217;s first Christmas and spent almost a week with my family.&nbsp; Everyone loved and was amazed by Poppy, of course and she did splendidly.&nbsp; She traveled quite well, sleeping for the first part of both flights and playing quietly for the second.&nbsp; She also did a remarkably good job dealing with all the people she didn&#8217;t really know and the back and forth craziness of going from house to house to house.&nbsp; We of course had a great time and look forward to seeing all of the family again this summer for the bi-annual reunion (every two years).
