My boss just sent me a link to the following article:

  * [PHP catching on at enterprises, vying with Java][1]
Not only is it cool my boss sent it to me, but the content of the article is great news for anyone who is a fan of [PHP][2]&#8230; (and anyone who doesn&#8217;t know if they are or not, I very much am&#8230; so if you can&#8217;t form your own opinion on the topic, you may borrow mine) As more and more businesses realize the power, flexibility, and simplicity of PHP &#8211; as it comes into the mainstream more and more &#8211; I get more chances to work with it, teach friends about it, get paid to build stuff with it&#8230; etc.
