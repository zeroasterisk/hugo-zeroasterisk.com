After a very short time at the company, I&#8217;m (currently) at the company meeting in Dallas, TX.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been fantastic, and for me to say that about a company meeting &#8211; you had better recognize the significance.&nbsp; The people are spread out over the country and all work in their own areas, so most I havn&#8217;t met.&nbsp; The purpose of these meetings is to get together and basically say what we&#8217;ve each done and what we&#8217;re going to be doing.

No exageration, everyone seems to be exceptional at what they do (I was going to say &#8220;more than competent&#8221;).&nbsp; I&#8217;ve said from the beginning that the company seems like it&#8217;s positioned well for success and I certainly believe one of the reasons they (we) will succeede is the people here at this meeting.

I feel like I&#8217;ve drank the kool-aid, so to speak.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s really good so far.

Also, there&#8217;s been good food and shuffleboard.&nbsp; I&#8217;m a sucker for easy going people and a game of some sort where you can heckle.

Lots of work ahead, but that&#8217;s nothing new.&nbsp; Things going well.
