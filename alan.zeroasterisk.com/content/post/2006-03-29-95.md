[Sci-Fi Film Fest in Columbus][1] from noon Saturday, April 22 until noon Sunday, April 23 @ the Drexel.

Yup &#8211; I&#8217;m going&#8230; you should come&#8230; you should bring your friends&#8230;

geeks &#8211; unite, support the geeks who are putting on this event, and eventually &#8211; take over the world (the same thing we do every night, pinky).
