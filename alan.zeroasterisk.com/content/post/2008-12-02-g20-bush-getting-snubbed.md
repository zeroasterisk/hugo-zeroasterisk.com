I&#8217;m one of the first to speak out against the current (soon-to-change-thank-god) US government, but this video really does make me sad. I have little to say positive toward G.W.Bush and have certainly complained about him (often) when really complaining about the actions of many many people&#8230; but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d go so far as to refuse to shake his hand. I mean, he&#8217;s still a person.

On the otherhand, I myself have toyed with the idea of considering him a mass murderer&#8230; so from that perspective, I wouldn&#8217;t want to shake his hand or be in the same room with him.
