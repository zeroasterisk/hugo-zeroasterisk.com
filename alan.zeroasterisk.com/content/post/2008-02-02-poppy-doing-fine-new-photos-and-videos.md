Poppy is doing great &#8211; an absolute joy to have around 95% of the time.&nbsp; She can get fussy sometimes, but it&#8217;s not bad at all &#8211; and she&#8217;s so happy most of the time.

We&#8217;ve gotten better at giving baths and getting dressed and diapering.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve using about 50%/50% cloth and disposable diapers.&nbsp; We&#8217;d like to use more cloth, but they really don&#8217;t fit her yet, they are too big.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got the covers and pins, but are far from experts as of yet.

Depending on when the last time you checked, I&#8217;ve uploaded a few new photos to the &#8220;[home for the first week][1]&#8221; album (starting after the carseat photo).&nbsp; Also, on the [homepage][2], there is a video viewer, now with a playlist.&nbsp; As I get more videos uploaded they will show up in the list.
