If my perspective on the world were comprised of tectonic plates &#8211; it&#8217;s as if a new continent has formed, replete with earthquakes, tsunamis, and the readjustment of every other piece of the former world. That analogy is poor, because in my case, all these changes are great. Great is an understatement; magnificent is an understatement.

So &#8211; here&#8217;s the short story for those who haven&#8217;t heard it yet.

Anita labored for ~25 hours and gave birth to Penelope Lou Blount at 13:33 EDT on Thursday, Jan 24 2008. Both Anita&#8217;s mother and I were there for the labor and delivery; and we can vouch for the heroic efforts of Anita &#8211; it is easily the strongest I&#8217;ve ever seen anybody. The birth was absolutely the most miraculous thing I&#8217;ve ever been a part of, specifically the moment when Poppy&#8217;s blue/purple body first clicked on &#8211; like the finger of god animating Adam in the Sistine chapel&#8230; Zap, she&#8217;s alive&#8230; (ha &#8211; kind of like Frankenstein&#8217;s monster in that respect, I suppose&#8230; but so much more cute)

Poppy was born at 8 pounds 9 ounces, 21 inches long, 10 fingers, 10 toes, and absolutely perfect. Every parent says that about their child&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry to have to prove all you other parents wrong.

Both of Anita and I stayed in the hospital with Poppy in the room, until she was about 52 hours old. We were visited by a ton of family and friends, and kept in luxurious comfort by the support of Anita&#8217;s sisters and family (big thanks to April, Billy, and Virginia). We got home Saturday evening and have been fed food and given baby-holding-breaks daily from our ongoing family support. We get to sleep for a couple of hours at a time these days, but Penelope is so good I feel like we&#8217;re doing better than most. Perhaps we&#8217;re still in the honeymoon phase.

Update: 2008.01.29

We went to Poppy&#8217;s first pediatrician appointment and she&#8217;s now 9 pounds and 7 ounces. That&#8217;s right, she&#8217;s gained a pound since birth&#8230; in fact more than that, as she lost weight down to 8#2oz when she left the hospital. She seems to be perfectly healthy and happy. We are ecstatic!
