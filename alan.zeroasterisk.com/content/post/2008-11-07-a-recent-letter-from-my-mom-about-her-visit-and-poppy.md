An email from my Mom who recently visited us. It&#8217;s a great recap and update on Poppy, so I&#8217;m just pasting in here:

> I recommend becoming a grandmother &#8212; it&#8217;s the best! I have just returned from a week in Louisville with Alan and Anita&#8230;and Poppy, which included two Halloween parties, a wedding in Columbus, a long walk in Iroquois park to check out the fall colors, two swimming lessons for Poppy (with Anita), and progress made on Poppy&#8217;s room mural by my good friend, Joan Firster and me. Lots of walks, quality time with Poppy, and with Alan and Anita, dining out, dining in, a little gardening, and a delicious pre-Thanksgiving feast at Karen and Bryan&#8217;s, plus a tour of their amazing new back yard and brick patio.

> Poppy (who was 9 months on Oct. 24, and is holding steady at 19# [60 percentile for weight] and measuring 29&#8243; [90 percentile for height]: ) is all about mobility these days&#8211;pulling herself up to a standing position and holding on while she walks around tables, chairs, sofas, and taller toys, like her current favorite: plastic kitchen appliances (see photo). She climbs the steps without hesitation and when she gets to the top, she&#8217;s ready to go down (holding on to your two pointy fingers), and at the bottom, she can hardly wait to turn around and climb up again. I spotted her up and down one day 8 times till I had to stop!

> Another fun activity that never gets old is that she likes to dance. If she&#8217;s sitting, she&#8217;ll rock back and forth on her bottom and sometimes also move her arms. If she&#8217;s standing and becomes aware of music, she will bend those knees and be-bop up and down. She&#8217;ll dance to silly songs you might sing, even if you&#8217;ve forgotten some of the words. It&#8217;s all the same to her if she can catch a beat.

> Besides mom&#8217;s milk, she is eating a variety of fruits and veggies but no sugar, milk, or peanut butter that might get her into trouble. She&#8217;s got 2 teeth on the bottom and 4 on the top, and it&#8217;s remarkable what those teeth can do. She takes about 3 naps a day, plus car trip naps are extra. Her naps keep everyone on an even keel. Alan and Anita both realize they&#8217;re very lucky that Miss Poppy is such a good baby and that she&#8217;s healthy and, of course, above average.

> Photos include two of Poppy in her Halloween costume: she was a Roller Derby Girl, complete with fishnet stockings. Check out the &#8220;skates&#8221; Anita made. There are also two of the family at Iroquois Park with fall color all around. Fall color in Louisville seems electric &#8211;especially the reds. Beautiful! I also reminded them how lucky they are that all those trees exhibiting fall color are on their neighbors&#8217; lots and not theirs. I know first hand as we have lots and lots of leaves to rake every year, but without the electric colors. (would you believe brown?)
