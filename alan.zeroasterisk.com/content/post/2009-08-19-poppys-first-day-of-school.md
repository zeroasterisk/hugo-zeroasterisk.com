Poppy&#8217;s really thinned out and sped up. At 18 months, she&#8217;s about the same height as she was at 14 months, but seems much more thin. Must be all the running, jumping, and climbing she does. She can happily run in a circle for 15 minutes, or bounce on a bed for 30.

She&#8217;s started school at &#8220;The Friend&#8217;s School&#8221; this week, in the 1 year old class three days a week for three hours each day. Two of her buddies are in the same class, and 5 other kids along with two teachers who attempt semi-organized activities.
