I am now hired on a 2 month contract with [via studio][1], a very well respected design/development/consulting company. This may turn into a long term position, but the 2 month contract period is a good trial run for them and for me. I&#8217;ll update as I have more information.

Today is my last day of work at Mercer. It has ended lack-luster (painfully), but the whole experience has been great for me. I have been able to add many skills and accomplishments to my resume, I made many good working connections, and have been treated pretty well, for the most part. Things are ending on as good a note as a layoff can, I suppose.

It&#8217;s cold as hell in Louisville today. 18 degrees. Making for a dreary greyhound ride back to Columbus this evening&#8230; I&#8217;m signing off now to go wait at the station.
