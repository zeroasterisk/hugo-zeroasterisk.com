If anyone is interested, go to [https://political.moveon.org/donate/breakingthelaw.html][1] to view the commercial spot (and the facts behind it) MoveOn is trying to get on the air. I&#8217;ve long said Bush is as bad or worse than Nixon &#8211; indeed, it looks like others are saying the same thing, better.

And of course, if you wanted to play a similar game try [waronterrortheboardgame.com][2].
