It&#8217;s been a crazy winter, the last week. The ice storm which took out most of KY&#8217;s power only kept us out for a couple of days, but still has some friends down. It was crazy to see all of the trees weighed down and drooping, beautiful and terrible. The ice coated everything, and when the wind blew all of the ice-coated limbs and branched clinked with each other.

Here&#8217;s a great photo from a friend of mine, mitch:

And another photo from another friend, ramey:

Luckily, we are all alright and everyone we know is as well. Nice to be reminded how fragile our infrastructure is and how dead-in-the-water most of us are without it.
