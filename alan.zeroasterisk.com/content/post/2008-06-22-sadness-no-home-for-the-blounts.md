We had gotten VERY excited about a house we were going to buy.

We made an offer, they countered, we accepted&#8230; all today (Sunday). We were waiting on the counter-offer-paperwork to sign and send back&#8230; well, instead of getting that, we actually got notified that the offer was retracted. Someone else made a better offer and we weren&#8217;t given an option to bid back.

Of course, this was after we&#8217;d told everyone and after we&#8217;d gotten really, really excited about this house. It really was perfect for us &#8211; expandable, large, great neighborhood, great character and charm&#8230; it really felt like us&#8230; the 30 other houses we&#8217;ve looked at all paled in comparison.

Now we&#8217;re depressed, we feel like we&#8217;ve looked at all the available houses in the areas we want to live in, which are large enough.

In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor annoyance. We&#8217;ve got our jobs, our health, our family and friends &#8211; and the most beautiful and perfect little girl&#8230; we&#8217;re doing great. But I&#8217;m still feeling very sorry for myself.
