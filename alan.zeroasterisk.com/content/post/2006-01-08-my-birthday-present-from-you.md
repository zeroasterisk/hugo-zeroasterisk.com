It will be my 27th birthday in on Jan 17th. That is not exciting, but I&#8217;m going to try to use it as a ploy to get you (yes &#8211; you, the person reading this right now) to give me a present.

It wont take money, and really only say&#8230; 10 minutes of your time.

Please (please) read the following article:

> [Blair Criminalizes His Critics][1] by [John Pilger][2].

So many people have put what I would like to be able to say, more succinctly and convincingly than I can&#8230; so read their work. Honestly, I really don&#8217;t have a lot of personal experience to go on, I haven&#8217;t been to war ravaged areas, but I believe they exist and are more news worthy than what we are fed through major media channels. Listen to some of the people who have seen more of what is really going on and who are not supporters of the regime, currently in control.

Seriously. Read it. If you have any desire to, leave a comment on this post, or email me, or pass on the article, or read more, or help figure a way out of our hand basket.

I honestly don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m paranoid-delusional&#8230; I think the delusion is what everyone thinks is &#8220;normal&#8221; &#8211; the 6 o&#8217;clock news and movie star drama. We have lost our freedom and the safeguards for it. We seem to have (as a nation) lost any interest in demanding our freedom back. What is next?
