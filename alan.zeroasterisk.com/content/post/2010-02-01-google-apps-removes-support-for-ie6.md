> Many other companies have already stopped supporting older browsers like Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers. We’re also going to begin phasing out our support, starting with Google Docs and Google Sites. As a result you may find that from March 1 key functionality within these products &#8212; as well as new Docs and Sites features &#8212; won’t work properly in older browsers.

> 2010 is going to be a great year for Google Apps and we want to ensure that everyone can make the most of what we are developing. Please take the time to switch your organization to the most up-to-date browsers available.

I&#8217;m hoping this will be the killing stroke to a browser which has single-handedly caused me more frustration than any other piece of software, ever.
