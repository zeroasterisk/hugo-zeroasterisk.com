I just got done reading : [The Brutal Christ of the Armageddonites &#8211; by Jon Basil Utley][1]

It&#8217;s a great overview of / perspective on the Christian &#8220;pro-end-of-the-world&#8221; movement which has begun (in this country) to not only become fairly popular, but to be largely represented in the government and the financial elite.&nbsp;

This is, no doubt frightening&#8230; but again, it brings me back to one of my major complaints about most organized religion&#8230; arrogance.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t understand how anyone could honestly believe they &#8220;understand god&#8221; &#8211; if they actually believed in god or anything greater than themselves, they should be more humble and less righteous in their discourse on that which is so much greater than themselves&#8230;&nbsp; _&#8220;I&#8217;ve got this god all figured out&#8230; so let me tell you about it&#8230; he just happens to agree with everything I believe and he hates anyone who doesn&#8217;t agree with him (me).&#8221;_

here are a couple of quotes from the aforementioned article:



> &#8230;it was erstwhile House Majority Leader [Tom DeLay][2] who argued that the Iraq war should be supported because it is a precursor to the second coming of Christ. He also tried to undermine the Bush &#8220;roadmap for peace&#8221; when he visited Israel.</p>
> &#8220;Tim LaHaye, the co-author of the hugely popular &#8216;Left Behind&#8217; series, spoke of Iraq as &#8216;a focal point of end-time events,&#8217; whose special role in the earth&#8217;s final days will become clear after invasion, conquest, and reconstruction. For his part, Jerry Falwell boasted that &#8216;God is pro-war&#8217; in the title of an essay he wrote in 2004.&#8221;

> Such a &#8216;war of the cross&#8217; should strike Christians as a contradiction in terms. A literal war in the name of Jesus – a &#8216;Christian war&#8217; – is an oxymoron, like &#8216;hateful Christian.&#8217; Jesus said that His kingdom was not of this world, otherwise His followers would draw swords to defend Him – and presumably the kingdom itself (John 18:36).
