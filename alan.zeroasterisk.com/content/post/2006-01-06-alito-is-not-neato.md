Over 750,000 people have signed on to a letter urging the Senate to reject Samuel Alito&#8217;s nomination to the Supreme Court. If you sign on, we&#8217;re that much closer to making it a full one million: [Sign the letter][1], (I did).

You can also use [MoveOn.org][2] to [send a letter to your senator about Alito][3].

Personally, I think the lifetime apointments of Supreme Court Justices is dangerous in it&#8217;s own right, but I can understand it to some extent&#8230; I just think it&#8217;s dangerous that the court can sway &#8211; and then be stuck in it&#8217;s sway for so long. Here&#8217;s to not letting it sway too far right (with luck).
