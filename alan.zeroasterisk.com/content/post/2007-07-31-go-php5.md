    <p>
      PHP 4 has served the web developer community for seven years now, and<br /> served it well. However, it also shows its age. Most of PHP 4&#8217;s<br /> shortcomings have been addressed by PHP 5, released three years ago,<br /> but the transition from PHP 4 to PHP 5 has been slow for a number of<br /> reasons.
