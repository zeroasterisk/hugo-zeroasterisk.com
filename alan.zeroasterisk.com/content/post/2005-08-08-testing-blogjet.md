I don&rsquo;t have anything interesting going on right now, so here&rsquo;s some of the stuff going on in the world today (that I was interested in):

techie stuff

  * [Google snubs tech news outlet CNET][1]&nbsp;&ndash; Google CEO got &ldquo;googled&rdquo; and is upset about the demonstration of people&rsquo;s complain at all the personal information readily available&hellip;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just that the info is so easy to get at&hellip;&nbsp; (personally, that doesn&rsquo;t bother me &ndash; information is simply information, not all of it is true but whatever is, should be available&hellip; in&nbsp;my ideal world there would be no need to worry about privacy concerns&hellip; too bad we&rsquo;re not there yet.)
  * [Flash8 released soon][2]&nbsp;&ndash; it&rsquo;ll be great, as soon as everyone is upgraded to F8&hellip; in about 2 years.
  * [M$ security patches][3]&nbsp;== Windows sucks, but you kinda have to use it for most business jobs and most games and most applications&hellip;&nbsp; kinda like doing business with the wal-marts of the world&hellip; though wal-mart is less likely to break&hellip;&nbsp; in fact, almost anything is less likely to break than Windows.

bush = worst president Ever<img height="242" alt="worst president ever" src="http://intellectualize.org/images/worst_president_ever_sm.jpg" width="182" align="right" border="0" />

  * [Bush Signs Energy Bill][4]&nbsp;&ndash; anything Bush touches is horrible
  * [Mother of Slain Soldier Protests Bush at Ranch][5]&nbsp;&ndash; _&#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to justify my son&#8217;s honorable sacrifice to continue his murderous killing policies&#8221;_&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Cindy Sheehan

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">other news</span>

  * [Ohio highway sniper sentenced to 27 years][6]&nbsp;&ndash; good.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s freaky to think about how easily and quickly anyone could be killed driving to the store&hellip;
  * [Brazil Burglary, $68 Million stolen via a tunnel][7]&nbsp;&ndash; this seems rather movie-plotish, but I expect it must actually happen.
