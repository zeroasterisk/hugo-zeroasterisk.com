I read the following [blog post][1] linked from slashdot. It is part of the blog for [SiteAdvisor][2]&#8230; a tool for testing for adware / spyware.

Those of you who still run into problems with adware and spyware, you might want to try this app out&#8230; it couldn&#8217;t hurt (unless it was a really clever double-agent type scam to get you to install it. no &#8211; i don&#8217;t think it is&#8230;.. yes, it might be. no, not really&#8230; un-huh. mmmm-mmm. &#8212; _think Eddie Izzard style standup._)
