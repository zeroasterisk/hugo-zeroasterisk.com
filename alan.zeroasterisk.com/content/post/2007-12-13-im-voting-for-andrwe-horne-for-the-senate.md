Not that it matters to most of you, but a [friend of mine][1] reminded me that I should indicate [who I am voting for][2]&#8230;&nbsp; If for nothing else I like the following line:

> I offer trustworthy, competent and genuine leadership. I am not a Politician.

Of course, anyone can say that &#8211; but my general feeling is that he would be a good Senator.
