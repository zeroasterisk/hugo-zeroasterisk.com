Well&#8230; it&#8217;s been a day &#8211; just like any other day.&nbsp; I wore black&#8230; biked to work&#8230; worked&#8230; biked home and walked in the park with Anita and Nova.&nbsp; A beautiful day.&nbsp; Nothing in my day to tie this date with six years ago&#8230; I was looking for it to come up.

Perhaps if I watched television more, or talked to strangers more&#8230;&nbsp; perhaps if I got out of my daily life and tried to make a change in the world which reflected my beliefs (such as they are)&#8230;&nbsp; perhaps if I didn&#8217;t live so comfortably I&#8217;d work to fix what seems obviously wrong with the world.

Unfortunately, that does seem to be what it comes down to.&nbsp; I value my ability to provide for my family above most other things.&nbsp; An argument could be made that activism which resulted in an improvement in the world would be a better service to one&#8217;s family&#8230; but I&#8217;m not that optimistic.&nbsp; I believe change can happen &#8211; must happen &#8211; and if a critical mass of people lean in a direction, the country will follow&#8230; but I don&#8217;t know how much I can contribute&#8230;&nbsp;&nbsp; cop-out.

Since I can not seem to improve the world beyond my normal daily routine&#8230; I can not proselytize that anyone else should.

Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ve got punishment enough; knowing that the current American Government is corrupt and criminal, but not doing anything about it.&nbsp; End in sight?&nbsp; Probably not.
