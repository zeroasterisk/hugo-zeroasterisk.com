saw dan bern last night&#8230; he&#8217;s fantastic &#8211; still &#8211; always.

his second song was &#8220;I do what I have to do to make me feel like a man&#8230;&#8221; which is a great song.&nbsp; during it, watching him, I realized that I too, am a man&#8230; 

sounds stupid, I know. I&#8217;ve been married for 6 years and have a real job and real responsibilities and nothing has changed in my life much for the last couple of years&#8230;. but it was almost a shock to realize that &#8220;i am a man&#8221;.&nbsp; I would call myself male or a guy or whatever&#8230; not a boy; but not a man&#8230;&nbsp; I&#8217;m not a manly person &#8211; i don&#8217;t have a lot to prove and my ego is focused on other things most of the time&#8230;&nbsp; but&#8230;&nbsp; i am a man.

crazy.

makes me think of the &#8220;now you are a man&#8230; manny-man man&#8221; song on Orgazmo&#8230;&nbsp; 

Of course, I don&#8217;t have to worry about being as much of a man as Dan Bern &#8211; that isn&#8217;t possible.&nbsp; Were I to ever end up gay, it would probably be Dan who turned me.&nbsp; He is such a virile&#8230; man.
