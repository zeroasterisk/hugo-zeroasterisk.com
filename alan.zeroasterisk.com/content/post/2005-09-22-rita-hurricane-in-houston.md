An Email to/from Cathy (my mom) who lives in Houston, in response to the coming hurricane everyone is freaking out about (because of the recent Katrina problems in New Orleans).

> I&#8217;m sure you have better offers closer&#8230; but columbus is probably out of the path of any natural disaster i can think of&#8230;

**From Cathy**

> Thanks for the invite.

> Right now I am moving plants to the greenhouse (they could become missiles)

> and Sam is moving all the other stuff&#8230;.except where do you move 1500

> E mail while you can&#8211;phone lines are all tied up.

> No time for chit chat. Gotta move.

> Will try to keep in touch.
