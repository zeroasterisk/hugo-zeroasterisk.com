As you can see below &#8211; it&#8217;s cold and wet&#8230; It hasn&#8217;t stopped snowing or sleeting in about 24 hours.

Anita&#8217;s birthday was great.  I drove her to get coffee and then to school.  I picked up lunch and delivered it.  School actually got cancelled early today (unheard of here).  We hung out and watched Battlestar Gallactica for a while and then went to eat at the [Surly Girl][1] with some good friends.  Then we went back to our place and played pictionary.  Now Anita&#8217;s in bed and I&#8217;m sending a quick update.  I didn&#8217;t get much work done today, but can make up for it tomorrow.

All I can say is &#8211; I&#8217;m glad our car is 4-wheel-drive&#8230;  We are in much better shape than anyone else on the road.  Makes me warm and happy inside.
