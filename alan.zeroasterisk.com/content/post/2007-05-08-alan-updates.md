I haven&#8217;t been posting a lot&#8230; partially to keep the blog a bit more official while looking for employment and partially because I&#8217;ve been busy.

**work updates:**
So I&#8217;ve been working at [Via][1], from home, as a contractor.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been doing that since Feb.&nbsp; Working with friends and doing mostly LAMP development (thankfully).&nbsp; The only downside is that it&#8217;s a smaller company and can&#8217;t afford to pay me what other places can.

So about a month ago, I found a great job with a different company, but didn&#8217;t get it&#8230; I got another job with the same place which we thought we could make work for me&#8230; I worked there 4 miserable days and then went back to Via.&nbsp; The problem was not the company, but the work was mundane and there was a lot of it.&nbsp; I was very unhappy and Anita encouraged me to go back to the place I liked working, for a little less money.&nbsp; Sounded like good advice&#8230; so Via will hire me full time sometime soon and I think we&#8217;ll be good for each other for some time to come.

**health updates:**
I&#8217;m fine.&nbsp; Anita&#8217;s fine&#8230;&nbsp; We&#8217;ve been sick (Anita still is) but it passes.&nbsp; My Dad&#8217;s had leg problems and my Aunt&#8217;s cancer battle has taken a bad turn.&nbsp; If you know a way to help&#8230;&nbsp;

**music updates:**
Been listening to the Decemberists, Erin McKeown, Built to Spill, The White Stripes, etc&#8230;&nbsp; I was also lucky enough to go to the recent Hushaby event in Louisville and listen to SKL (Jason), Foursquare (Marea), and Angel from Chicago.&nbsp; It was a great show&#8230; I&#8217;ve got photos to post&#8230; soon.
