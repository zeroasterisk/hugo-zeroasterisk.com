I don&#8217;t often randomly surf for people&#8230; but this guy [[Matthias Wandel][1]] wrote some software I was using (for the first time, about 5-6 years ago) [[jhead][2]] and I randomly browsed over to his personal site and thought he was really (really) cool&#8230; Neat projects and inventions, done both logically and creatively (a combination I admire and strive for, though which I tend to exhibit to a lessor degree).

he came up in conversation again today and so I found his site again and found this page (among others) which just makes me go all warm and fuzzy:

<http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/marbles/machine2.html>

note the great [video][3] of the machine in action

and don&#8217;t forget to check out the first version:

<http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/marbles/machine1.html> [[video][4]]

or the [home made pipe organ][5] or the [scanning camera][6] or the [cannon][7]&#8230; etc&#8230;

cool stuff, cool stuff&#8230;

(looking forward to having a workshop when we move back to Louisville)
