We have made an offer on [183 Coral Ave][1]. and it was accepted (finally).

You may have [heard about the problems][2] we had with the [last house][3] we were interested in, so were were trying not to get our hopes up too much &#8211; but now we are signed and contracted&#8230; good to go.

The house is big enough with a little expansion room in the basement, across the street from a great park and on an almost double lot. It&#8217;s got a couple of small decks and a brick patio.

The house is being inspected on July 7th. We close on Aug. 1st.

Also &#8211; just in case anyone is interested, here&#8217;s a [map of places we&#8217;ve lived][4], that&#8217;s not quite complete yet, but it does include the new house.
