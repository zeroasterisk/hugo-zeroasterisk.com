Anita and many of the mom&#8217;s took their offspring to [Tyler Park][1] today.

Poppy was somewhat fussy, all day and in fact all month&#8230; she&#8217;s getting teeth and she&#8217;s frustrated that she can&#8217;t really walk on her own yet.&nbsp; Life is hard.

So hard, in fact, that sometimes, if you&#8217;re a baby, you just gotta eat some leaves and puke&#8230; which she did, with abandon.&nbsp; What we didn&#8217;t figure out until ~9pm tonight was that one of those leaves was stuck to the roof of her mouth for over 5 hours.&nbsp; 

She wasn&#8217;t eating right, and seemed a little weird&#8230; in retrospect her actions certainly indicated that there might be a leaf stuck in her mouth, but neither of us thought to check for one.

Anyhow, she&#8217;s fine and asleep and happy.&nbsp; Just a funny little story.
