The past week (starting at the end of last week actually) Anita and I have been insufferably busy. I&#8217;ve been working till midnight or later Sat-Wed&#8230; anita has, if anything, been working more&#8230; studying for finals and taking finals. 

Luckily, the fires at my work seem to be more under control and Anita is, as of today, done with her tests&#8230; She of course doesn&#8217;t know her results, but I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s doing fine&#8230; 

And, I think we have finalized [our travel plans][1].
