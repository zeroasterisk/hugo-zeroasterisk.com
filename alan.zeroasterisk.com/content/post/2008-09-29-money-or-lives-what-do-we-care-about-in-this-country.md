Something has come to me, in the light of the current financial crisis in this country&#8230; 

Most people in this country are now aware that we are on the brink of a depression as serious as the one in the 1930s.&nbsp; People are up in arms, talking to their congressional representatives and it is all over the media.&nbsp; There&#8217;s action (or at least attempted and perhaps misguided action) in our government to fix some of the problems, and we are all sure the sky is falling and things need to be done.

My revalation: We saw nothing like this action and activity when it came to light how corrupt our government already was, in relation to the US invading Iraq.&nbsp; How self-centered we are, that when our money is directly effected we are all ready to act on something.&nbsp; Whereas, when the problems are someone else&#8217;s most of our country is content to sit back and maybe talk about the subject&#8230;

Of course some people marched on Washington and some impotently raged (I&#8217;m in the later category), but on the whole, most people didn&#8217;t notice that we ruined another country from top to bottom and have done a poor job in putting it back together&#8230; oh yeah, and we killed [87,833-95,866][1] iraqis and lost [4175][2] US troops (as of today).

There hasn&#8217;t been a flurry of activity that I know of on scale with this financial scare.

Sure, our economy is going down in flames for a few years.&nbsp; We&#8217;re looking at a very hard few years, and hopefully a period of some serious and deep rooted changes in our government and country as a whole.&nbsp; As I see it we are long overdue for both the hard times and the changes&#8230;&nbsp; 

I just find it disgusting that our motivation is so self-centered when we had ample opportunity to get disgusted at killing and loosing many lives in the name of stupidity&#8230; in the name of oil&#8230; in the name of believing that the West could &#8220;fix the world&#8221; with deadly force.&nbsp;
