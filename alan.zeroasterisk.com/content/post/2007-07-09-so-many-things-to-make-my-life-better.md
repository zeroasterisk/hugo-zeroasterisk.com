I&#8217;ve been using the &#8220;Control Suite&#8221; for a couple of development projects and I&#8217;m 100% pleased.&nbsp; The tools are modular (so you can take what you want), class based (so they don&#8217;t break your other code), well documented, fast, easy, and clean.

Anyone who works with/develops AJAX and a dynamic web-user-interface&#8230; especially if you already use [prototype][1]&#8230; I highly recommend you try this set of tools.
