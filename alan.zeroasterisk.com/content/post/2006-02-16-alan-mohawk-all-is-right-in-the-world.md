Yes, once again, Alan is in posession of a mohawk&#8230;&nbsp; life is good &#8211; life is good.&nbsp;

A mohawk is a wonderful thing for several reasons.&nbsp; Some of them are:

  * I have hair on the top of my head still, might as well enjoy it.
  * It improves my ultimate frisbee game (seriously).
  * It reminds me and anyone else that I&#8217;m not really all the way old, yet.
  * It helps instantly filter people, like John&#8217;s pants, for any who know.
  * It requires some maintainence (frown) but no commitment (I can shave it whenever).

see &#8211; a lot better than buying a sports car and going to a tanning place.

oh and also checkout this [video of an awesome multi-touch-screen demo][1]&#8230; yeah &#8211; cool stuff coming&#8230; (reminds me of an audio interface based on glass &#8220;pucks&#8221; which was really tight)
