While suturing a cut on the hand of a 75-year-old Texas rancher, whose hand was caught in a gate while working cattle, the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man. Eventually, the topic got around to former Texas Governor George W. Bush and his elevation to the White House. 

The old Texan said, &#8220;Well, ya know, Bush is a &#8216;post turtle&#8217;.&#8221; Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a &#8216;post turtle&#8217; was. 

The old rancher said, &#8220;When you&#8217;re driving down a country road and you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top, that&#8217;s a post turtle.&#8221; The old man saw a puzzled look on the doctor&#8217;s face, so he continued to explain, &#8220;You know, he didn&#8217;t get there by himself, he doesn&#8217;t belong there, he doesn&#8217;t know what to do while he&#8217;s up there, and you just want to help the dumb shit get down!&#8221;
