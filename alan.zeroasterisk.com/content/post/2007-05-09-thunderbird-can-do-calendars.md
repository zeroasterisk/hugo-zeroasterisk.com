I&#8217;ve switched all my personal email to gmail, and have been using it for a couple of years now (i think).

But, I have work emails which I can not just forward (or would get confusing if I did).&nbsp; So, of course, I use Thunderbird &#8211; which is perfect&#8230; but it doesn&#8217;t have a calendar.

Well, now it does.

Check out [this tutorial][1] which gives an overview of 2 different plugins which allow 2-way communication between thunderbird and your google calendar.&nbsp;

Zing!
