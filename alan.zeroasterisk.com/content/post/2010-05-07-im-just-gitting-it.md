Everyone and their mom have been using Git and GitHub for a while, but I&#8217;m just breaking down and using it&#8230; I have been slow to adopt because SVN worked for me fine (until I had to merge branches) and I don&#8217;t like to pay for storage space.  But I continue to be impressed by it&#8217;s functionality and ease of use, so I&#8217;m going to move our work repositories over (needing a Large account probably) but I think it will be worth it.
