Baby Watch Update: 2008.01.23 @ 4pm

Anita&#8217;s been having some serious contraction for a while&#8230; it could be early labor or it could be pre-labor. Even if this isn&#8217;t it, we have an appointment tomorrow morning for induction since Penelope is probably pretty big, and Anita is not (relatively speaking).

So &#8211; tonight or tomorrow.

We&#8217;re at home now and likely to remain here until we&#8217;re convinced she&#8217;s in labor (contractions ~5 min apart for an hour, with a change in activity in between)&#8230; or until tomorrow morning at 9am. If she waits till tomorrow, they&#8217;re going to induce with a small amount of pitocin for a couple hours and see how that goes&#8230; then a larger dose. Earlier that scared us, because we didn&#8217;t want to force her body to do something it wasn&#8217;t ready to do, but as things stand now &#8211; she&#8217;s ready &#8211; things are happening &#8211; we&#8217;re happy/excited/nervous/eager.

I&#8217;ll take a laptop + camera to the hospital and if I end up with any down time, I&#8217;ll post/email updates&#8230; If not &#8211; you&#8217;ll just have to wait for the aftermath.

thanks,

A+A+P
