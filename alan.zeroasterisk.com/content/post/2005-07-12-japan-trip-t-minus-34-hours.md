All of the &#8220;final&#8221; preperations for the [trip to Japan][1] are (almost) complete. We are packed and will be going to Louisville on Wednesday night&#8230; then flying to japan Thursday morning &#8211; flying until sometime friday (Japan time) and the train&#8217;ing to April&#8217;s town&#8230; arriving sometime Friday night&#8230;. We are not looking forward to the travel time, but super excited about going. We have packed a hiking backpack apiece and books and music&#8230;

I&#8217;ll update as we go (if i can) and will be collecting photos&#8230; _so exciting_
