[Phil][1] sent me a link to the article [[Appalachian town mining for land][2]] which is talking about the removal of mountains by a coal mining company as a positive thing&#8230; to some it may well be &#8211; but as coal mining companies are notorious for their environmental horrors, and as we are already starting to &#8220;run low&#8221; on mountains that have been created (tectonically) for thousands of years &#8212; perhaps people ought to think about keeping their mountains around as long as they can (which is basically until a mining company finds something they want in said mountain).

My friend [Kelly][3] has been informed on the goings-on of the mining industry on a recent visit to an activist friend living on-site&#8230; her [informative blog posting][4] has been disturbing and eye opening&#8230; Like so many others, I wish there was some actual US media coverage on this (or in fact, on anything beyond the government endorsed party line)&#8230;

And in direct response to the CNN article linked above &#8211; **shame** on them &#8211; without mentioning any of the negative views on the mountain top removal, CNN has basically endorsed the practice, the company, and the plan&#8230; Since most media avoid the subject completely, this creates a positive image of the removal of the Appalachian mountains in the mind of the general public.

who paid for this story?
