[AutoHotkey &#8211; Free Mouse and Keyboard Macro Program with Hotkeys and AutoText][1]:
  


> AutoHotkey is a free, open-source utility for Windows. With it, you can: </p> 
> 
>   * Automate almost anything by sending keystrokes and mouse clicks. You can write a mouse or keyboard macro by hand or use the macro recorder. 
>   * Create hotkeys for keyboard, joystick, and mouse. Virtually any key, button, or combination can become a hotkey. 
>   * Expand abbreviations as you type them. For example, typing &#8220;btw&#8221; can automatically produce &#8220;by the way&#8221;. 
>   * Create custom data entry forms, user interfaces, and menu bars. See GUI for details. * Remap keys and buttons on your keyboard, joystick, and mouse. 
>   * Respond to signals from hand-held remote controls via the WinLIRC client script. 
>   * Run existing AutoIt v2 scripts and enhance them with new capabilities. 
>   * Convert any script into an EXE file that can be run on computers that don&#8217;t have AutoHotkey installed.

Super useful!&nbsp; It&#8217;s very easy to add new strings with the helper at the bottom of the [hotstrings page][2].

Very useful for coders and support staff&#8230; anyone who types similar text over and over again.
