I recently came up with a VERY simple algebraic equation&#8230; trying to figure out how many months it would take for something to become cost effective.&nbsp; I looked at the equation and thought I would see if google search could solve it (it can solve basic math problems and even unit conversions), but google couldn&#8217;t handle it.&nbsp; So I thought I&#8217;d see if there was something else.&nbsp; It took no time to find [Algebrahelp.com.][1]

I [fed the calculator my equation][2]: {{ 2000\*X = (100\*X) + 3000 }} and got the following:

> <pre>Simplifying<br />2000X = (100X) + 3000<br /><br />Reorder the terms:<br />2000X = 3000 + (100X)<br /><br />Solving<br />2000X = 3000 + (100X)<br /><br />Solving for variable 'X'.<br /><br />Move all terms containing X to the left, all other terms to the right.<br /><br />Add '(-100X)' to each side of the equation.<br />2000X + (-100X) = 3000 + (100X) + (-100X)<br /><br />Combine like terms: 2000X + (-100X) = 1900X<br />1900X = 3000 + (100X) + (-100X)<br /><br />Combine like terms: (100X) + (-100X) = 0<br />1900X = 3000 + 0<br />1900X = 3000<br /><br />Divide each side by '1900'.<br />X = 1.578947368<br /><br />Simplifying<br />X = 1.578947368</pre>

Genius! &nbsp;Not only an answer, but an explanation! &nbsp;Yay Internet! &nbsp;I can&#8217;t wait to teach Penelope how to do Algebra&#8230; suppose I should wait till she&#8217;s born first though&#8230;
