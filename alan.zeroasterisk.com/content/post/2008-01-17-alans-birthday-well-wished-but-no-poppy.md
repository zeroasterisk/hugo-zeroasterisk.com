Perhaps there are just too many birthday reminders floating around, but I feel like everyone I&#8217;ve ever known has remembered my birthday this year.&nbsp; Not a big deal, but makes me feel good, regardless.&nbsp; Thanks to all the well wishers!

B-day has been great&#8230; a walk in the woods w/ Myra, followed by [fantastic sushi lunch][1] and great coffee&#8230; then to work (at work now)&#8230;

The only real complaint I have is that Penelope isn&#8217;t here yet.&nbsp; In fact, she&#8217;s already in trouble.&nbsp; I know she wasn&#8217;t due till the 24th, but I was just sure she&#8217;d come on my birthday and because she didn&#8217;t &#8211; she&#8217;s grounded.
