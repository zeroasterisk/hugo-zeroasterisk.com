Penelope has laughed in her sleep and has done some sort-of laughs along the way, but last night, for the first time, she laughed.&nbsp; We got several giggles from her.&nbsp; We were tickling her and of course giggling ourselves, but regardless &#8211; she laughed.&nbsp; We were beside ourselves, as would be expected.&nbsp; She&#8217;s starting to make some syllable sounds, but it&#8217;s not very far along as of yet.
