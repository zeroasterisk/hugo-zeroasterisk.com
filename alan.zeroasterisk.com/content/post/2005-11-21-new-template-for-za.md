So &#8211; the new template is up on zeroasterisk. Not only does it look different right now &#8211; this template is setup to be controlled by CSS, so I&#8217;ll be providing options on how to view the site. Until I offer those options (look in the top right hand corner of the page for them) you&#8217;ll have to make due with this one.

Also, I&#8217;ve updated to [gallery 2][1] and [mediawiki][2]&#8230; The wiki update means little to any users, but the gallery update may effect anyone who uses my gallery. It should work a lot better and offer a few more options for people who use the gallery. The admin / edit interface is a bit awkward, it&#8217;s just too much data for the narrow width of this default template&#8230; I&#8217;ll be working on enabling other views soon which may make this better&#8230; 

I&#8217;m also planning on makeing a homepage that&#8217;s kindof a portal &#8211; gathering the RSS feeds from the blog, wiki, and photos into a single page, allowing for easy viewing of what has recently been modified.
