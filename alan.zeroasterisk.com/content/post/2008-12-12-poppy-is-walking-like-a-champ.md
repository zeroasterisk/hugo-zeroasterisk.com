So there&#8217;s no going back&#8230; Though she&#8217;s still holding on to fingers when offered (or when produced after her sometimes insistent request) she is walking all the way across rooms without assistance and often without falling.&nbsp; For the most part, when she does fall, it&#8217;s fairly controlled and without incident.

All of our childproofing is being reassessed now.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a best effort thing anyway &#8211; for the most part, she&#8217;s going to get into whatever she can, we just try to remove the most dangerous and delicate things from 4 feet or lower.
