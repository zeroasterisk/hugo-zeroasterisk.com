I have really slacked on the the posting recently&#8230; I&#8217;ve had a good amount to talk about, but haven&#8217;t had the motivation to write anything. (at least none that coincides with available time)

I&#8217;ve played a lot of [I have really slacked on the the posting recently&#8230; I&#8217;ve had a good amount to talk about, but haven&#8217;t had the motivation to write anything. (at least none that coincides with available time)

I&#8217;ve played a lot of][1] with [cuda][2], and most recently at a [hat tournament][3] near Cinci. We even were lucky enough to watch the [College nationals][4], [in Columbus this year][5]&#8230; It&#8217;s a great game and the weather has been prefect for it (or for getting outside for any excuse).

Work is fine, normal&#8230; keeping at 40 hours a week recently&#8230; which is nice.

and soo&#8230; general updates completed&#8230; the hallmark which has initiated this post&#8230; my 10,000th day.

that&#8217;s right, about a third of the way through your 27th year, you will have been alive for 10,000 days&#8230; slightly different for different people due to leap years&#8230; but an often missed and extremely unique milestone-type-of-day. I first heard about when reading &#8220;[dancing naked in the mind field][6]&#8221; by Kary Mullis. I had planned on doing something significant to celebrate a the day&#8230; but find myself, smiling slightly more than usual&#8230; but just trying to find people to play board games with and spend some time in the park&#8230; I suppose I must be &#8220;old&#8221; now, as the simple pleasures are the best. Sorry, I don&#8217;t have any deeper insights to talk about or anything more significant to document. Perhaps that will come on my &#8220;[fibonacci sequence][7] day&#8221; (11,235). maybe not.
