My buddy Jason Smithson recently posted something about [mint.com][1] and I decided to check it out.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a fantastic site, very easy to use, and provides a very simple overview of the categories of my spending.

So, I know I spend X% on food and Y% on rent&#8230;

I&#8217;ve been nothing but impressed.

There&#8217;s also a &#8220;how to save money&#8221; section which strikes me as advertising and I&#8217;ve dutifully ignored it.
