I recently came across  [wolframalpha][1] which is really fantastic. It provides a much of data for a very wide variety of searches&#8230; basically the neat part is it&#8217;s conversion of English statements into data-based queries and graphs&#8230; It works across tons and tons of datatypes, including one of the most useful [weather reports][2] I&#8217;ve seen&#8230; simple and obvious and useful data across the board. (perhaps I just like graphs too much) It also has good [financial data][3], though I still prefer [google finance][4].

Also &#8211; here is something I&#8217;ve been waiting for, for a while &#8211; [google chrome os][5] &#8211; it&#8217;s basically a super-simple and fast booting OS meant to drop one into a web-browser and nothing else&#8230; I&#8217;ve got a laptop in the living room which aches for this&#8230; no need for a slow booting windows install nor a tricky-to-configure [webconverger][6] &#8211; just something to quickly get online and play music, check email, or look up recipes.
