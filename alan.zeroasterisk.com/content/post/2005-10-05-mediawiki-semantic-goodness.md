I feel like a spectator admiring athletes reading things like the this blog post [[Semantic Wikipedia - At last one of dreams is at the verge of coming true.][1]], but an excited spectator, none the less.

Wiki is already a fantastic tool for simple (or complex) content management, accessible to anyone within a few minutes&#8230; This proposed innovation would add the ability to add, inline, extra relationships which build a more complete (and interoperable) logical structure.

IMO &#8211; one of a Wiki&#8217;s strongest points has been how free form and structureless the system is &#8211; so you can do whatever you want with it&#8230;. but, there are downsides to a semi-structured system, specifically for accessibility and user understanding (overviews).

Enter: Semantic Markup

For more information on it, I strongly recommend you read the aforementioned [blog post][1] and [the Semantic MediaWiki/Implementation talk page][2].
