Poppy is now using her potty.

She&#8217;s been sitting on it for a while, but this weekend was the first time she actually used it successfully (twice so far).  We, of course, cheered and encouraged her&#8230; But I think it just clicked in her brain that was what she was supposed to do.  I don&#8217;t expect that we&#8217;re going to have a terribly high success rate right away, but it&#8217;s great to be on that path.
