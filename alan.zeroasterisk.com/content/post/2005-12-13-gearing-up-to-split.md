We are getting our stuff together to leave columbus for a while. We have house-sitters / cat-sitters for the majority of the time we are gone&#8230; and we are bringing Nova with us, to Louisville.

We are also bringing Ginni&#8217;s queen sized mattress (strapped to the roof of the CRV with ratchet-straps and bungies). That will make for a slightly slower drive, but shouldn&#8217;t be too bad (I hope). In addition, it will be Anita, Alan, John, and Nova in the car with a few weeks worth of stuff for all. Fun times getting loaded up tomorrow evening. I&#8217;m making MP3 CDs of audiobooks for the trip, right now.

Tonight we made some copies of keys for our house/cat sitters, and I stopped in at Best Buy and Circut City to buy a 60 gig iPod&#8230; and they were sold out. I could have special ordered one, but wouldn&#8217;t get it until (at the earliest) after 8 pm which would put us behind for getting to Lexington (where we plan on visiting Molly & Randy & young). I&#8217;m going to call some stores in Louisville and see if I can pre-order one there&#8230;

As for the past week&#8230; my work has slowed a bit &#8211; I&#8217;m able to breathe and stop at the end of the day, which is nice. Anita is done with classes and enjoying her break &#8211; though she is already aware it will be too short.
