This Jan. we thought it would be a good time to start looking for houses, since the rates came down&#8230; but being slow and you know, having a child &#8211; we just recently got out and actually looked at houses.

By now the rates are over 6% for a standard 30yr mortgage. We have perfect credit and decent everything else&#8230; but the lenders are just not passing along the reduced rates.

Furthermore &#8211; the costs of houses are unstable&#8230; in some ways that&#8217;s good for the buyer, as we could haggle more effectively&#8230; but the down side of that is &#8211; if we buy a house, in 2 months, the house may well be worth less than what we paid for it. That&#8217;s the whole problem with most of the junk loans and though ours wouldn&#8217;t be as serious as the ones all over the news, it&#8217;s still an issue.
