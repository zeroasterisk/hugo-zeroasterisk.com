Update &#8211; we are in Houston for April and May. Staying w/ family and

Anita&#8217;s doing her last rotation at a hospital here. They are kicking

her ass and not even saying sorry&#8230; but it&#8217;s the home stretch till

she&#8217;s finally done with school forever! (YAY)

Poppy is big-tastic. She is holding her head up all the time,

laughing a little (when tickled or otherwise super-excited) and smiling

a lot. She&#8217;s almost on a schedule &#8211; which includes 15-30 min of crying

every night at bed time&#8230; but she&#8217;s sleeping in her crib like a champ

and is doing very well. She&#8217;s a little better w/ tummy time and has

super strong legs&#8230; just need to work on those arm muscles.
