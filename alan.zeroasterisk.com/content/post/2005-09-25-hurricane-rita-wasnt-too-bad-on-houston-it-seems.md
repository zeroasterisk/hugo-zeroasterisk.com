I very briefly talked to mom today and she said her mom (Penny)&nbsp;went back to her home today and things seem normal enough.&nbsp; She was driving so I didn&rsquo;t get a full report, but judging by tone-of-voice, everything sounds fine.&nbsp; More information when&nbsp;I have it (and remember to post).
