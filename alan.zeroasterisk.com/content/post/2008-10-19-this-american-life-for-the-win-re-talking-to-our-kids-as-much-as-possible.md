[364: Going Big][1]

All of TAL is always great, moving, funny, and every other positive adjective I could think of (yes, I&#8217;m a fanboy)&#8230; but the first act in this show is about baby education and it&#8217;s importance&#8230;

> Paul Tough reports on the Harlem Children’s Zone, and its CEO and president, Geoffrey Canada. Among the project’s many facets is Baby College, an 8-week program where young parents and parents-to-be learn how to help their children get the education they need to be successful. Tough’s just-published book about Geoffrey Canada and the Harlem&#8217;s Children Zone is called Whatever It Takes. You can see a slideshow of more photographs from the project here. (30 and 1⁄2 minutes)

It&#8217;s worth listening to, but basically, one of the points I was struck by (@~11min) was that one of the main factors in the difference between successfully bright children and those who aren&#8217;t. The difference is that successful children heard more words&#8230; in the study cited, the &#8220;kids who made it&#8221; heard 20 million more words in the first 3 years and thus developed a bigger vocabulary early on, and could more easily handle the other basic building blocks of learning. If those building blocks are missing, they are hard to get later. (@~14min). Also &#8220;children of professionals&#8221; tended to hear 500,000 words of encouragement and only 80,000 words of discouragement, whereas &#8220;children of poverty&#8221; typically heard the opposite; 80,000 encouragement and 200,000 words of discouragement. (@~17min)

I&#8217;m sure all of us parents are doing great on this front, and in fact some of us have talked about this exact topic&#8230; but I was struck by the profundity of the topic and am myself encouraged to talk to poppy more, just doing idle tasks and whatnot.&nbsp; 

&#8220;now we are sweeping the floor.&nbsp; now you are eating something random off the floor.&nbsp; now we are looking out the window.&nbsp; now we are listening to NPR.&#8221;
