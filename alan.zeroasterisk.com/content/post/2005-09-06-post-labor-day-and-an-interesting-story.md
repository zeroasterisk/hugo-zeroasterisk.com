Saturday Anita had to work, but Phil, Sarah, Jess, and Phil&rsquo;s friend Tom came over and played [Mao][1]&nbsp;[[1]][2].&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great game &ndash; and surprisingly effective at bringing about a represive dictatorial feel in the players (who thought that could be so much fun?).&nbsp;

We played a variant where after winning 3 rounds you could make up your own rule&hellip;&nbsp; my personal favorite was (my rule): you have to use rapper hands whenever you call penalty on someone.

Sunday and Monday we went camping at Jess&rsquo;s Aunt property in the [Hocking Hills][3] area of OH.&nbsp; They have 70 acres of&nbsp;undeveloped into fantastic sandstone (mostly) cliff and rock formations,&nbsp;hilly and&nbsp;thick with&nbsp;forrest.&nbsp; It was really only psuedo camping (I couldn&rsquo;t even get the fire going without combustables due to dampness) but it was still gorgeous and great to get outdoors.

interesting: [Some M$ people seem to be a bit touchy about Google][4]

_Mr. Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room hitting a table in his office. Mr. Ballmer then said: &#8220;Fucking Eric Schmidt is a fucking pussy. I&#8217;m going to fucking bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again. I&#8217;m going to fucking kill Google.&#8221;&#8230;._
