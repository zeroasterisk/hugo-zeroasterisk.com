So, in August, apparentally, [Jeno][3] went to Peru&#8230; It looks like she toured the countryside and hiked up mountains&#8230; went to the amazon rainforest, boated across pink-dolphin infested waters, and got friendly with sheep and mules alike.

I want the full story&#8230; if i get it I will post it somewhere&#8230;. perhaps I can convince her to start a blog of her own&#8230;
