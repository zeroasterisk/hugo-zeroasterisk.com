[Skin Cells Converted to Stem Cells][1] which means we have &#8220;starter cells&#8221; for transplants and the like and don&#8217;t have to worry about the moral issues raised from using the tissues of aborted fetuses (feti?). [[Bush's statement on this]][2]

I&#8217;ve heard of this before, though&#8230; In fact, in [a previous article][3] from the [Washing Post][4]. My question really is, what is the quantity we are talking about? If we could produce enough stem cells to generate real tissues, doesn&#8217;t that kinda sound like vat grown replacement parts&#8230;. time for your 100,000 mile liver replacement.

I&#8217;m all for it if we go that route &#8211; it&#8217;s better than not being able to do so&#8230; but I fear we are not anywhere near that. I&#8217;m looking forward to vat grown anything (vat grown steaks will taste better because you didn&#8217;t have to kill an animal to get one) but have yet to really hear of any. Anyone want to point out some that I&#8217;ve missed?
