[YouTube &#8211; White and Nerdy- Weird Al][1]



This video/song is fantastic&#8230; it hits pretty close to home for me and several of my friends, though. Personally it&#8217;s hitting at least 40% acurate for me: 

I&#8217;m fluent in Javascript, do webpages for friends, got a friend who went to MIT, have stationary rims, i&#8217;ve got a soldering gun, i edit wikipedia, i can quote the whole &#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#8221;, and I wanna bowl with the gansta&#8217;s. 

I&#8217;ve don&#8217;t have a segway, i was never in any &#8220;clubs&#8221; in highschool, i don&#8217;t collect comics, no braces, don&#8217;t know pascal and i would really have to refresh at calculus, no action figures, and i don&#8217;t mow my lawn (live in an aparament).
