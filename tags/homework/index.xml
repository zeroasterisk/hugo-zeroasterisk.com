      <description>I have made the formal household declaration that all screen time will be matched, hour-for-hour with project time. Yesterday we cleaned the 1st floor, mopped and everything. Today we went grocery shopping, made lunch, and then started on homework time.
To say that I am unpopular here, would be an understatement.
But both of our kids will benefit from some extra assignements. Our education system is super lax, and a bit of supplimental assignment seems like a good idea.</description>
