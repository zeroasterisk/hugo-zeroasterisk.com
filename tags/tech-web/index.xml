      <description>I recently came across wolframalpha which is really fantastic. It provides a much of data for a very wide variety of searches&amp;#8230; basically the neat part is it&amp;#8217;s conversion of English statements into data-based queries and graphs&amp;#8230; It works across tons and tons of datatypes, including one of the most useful weather reports I&amp;#8217;ve seen&amp;#8230; simple and obvious and useful data across the board. (perhaps I just like graphs too much) It also has good financial data, though I still prefer google finance.</description>
