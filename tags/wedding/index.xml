      <description>We are home again, from a trip to San Francisco and Sonoma, California. (map)
The trip was for April&amp;#8217;s wedding (Anita&amp;#8217;s sister) to Billie one of our best friends from our three years in Columbus, OH.
We started out by going to Salt Point State Park and camping. We were able to hike to the beautiful (but cold) cliff-lined-coast and watch seals and waves alike. On our way back from camping we visited Fort Ross, the oldest establishment on the west coast, and old Russian trading post.</description>
