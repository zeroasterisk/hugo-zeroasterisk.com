      <description>I have made the formal household declaration that all screen time will be matched, hour-for-hour with project time. Yesterday we cleaned the 1st floor, mopped and everything. Today we went grocery shopping, made lunch, and then started on homework time.
To say that I am unpopular here, would be an understatement.
But both of our kids will benefit from some extra assignements. Our education system is super lax, and a bit of supplimental assignment seems like a good idea.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a bit proud of myself on this one&amp;#8230; I setup a simple, but clean and configurable, MySQL Master/Slave Replication Monitoring PHP Script:
http://code.google.com/p/php-mysql-master-slave-replication-monitor/ (docs)
It&amp;#8217;s Open Source and free, I welcome comments, suggestions, and questions.
I think this will be quite useful for anyone who is setting up a pair of MySQL servers as master/slave and want to be sure their replication works as it should.
