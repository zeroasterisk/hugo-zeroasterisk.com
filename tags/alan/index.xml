Introduction
I fix things, or try. Often breaking them till they work or they don&amp;rsquo;t. This applies to programs, web applications, websites, computers, artwork, food, friendships, relationships, people, and anything else I devote energy to.
Since fatherhood, the amount of time devoted to pretty much anything else has been drastically reduced. The amount of time devoted to my wonderful family has seen a significant increase; all is right with my very small part of the world, and I am truly grateful.</description>
